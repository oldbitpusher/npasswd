* Why this code...

The infamous Internet worm of November 1988 used among its attacks
a password guesser.  It is frightening how many passwords on how many UNIX
systems were guessed by this algorithim.  With the publication of various
papers about the internals of the worm, the password cracking algorithims
came to light.

I replicated the worm password cracker from those papers, ran it
against my password file and got too many hits to be comfortable.
I decided that some more rigourous validity checking was needed for passwords.

So I took the worm algorithim and rewrote it into a password checker.

A previous version of this code has appeared on comp.sources.misc.

* What this code does...

The sequence of checks done is:

	1. Enforcement of a minimal length.

	2. Simple 'lexical' checks to catch some dumb passwords, such as
	   repeats of the same letter (e.g. 'aaa').  Strange characters
	   are also checked for.

	3. Password is compared against some host-specific information, such as
	   the hostname.

	4. Password is checked against a number of permutations on the users'
	   passwd information (login name reversed, login name duplicated).

	5. Password is checked against the user's FINGER information.

	6. A list of dictionaries are scanned for the password.

All string comparsions are case-independant.

What kinds of passwords will be accepted:
	Passwords which use mixed upper and lower case.
	Passwords which use punctuation characters.
	Passwords which use numbers.
	Passwords which use allowed control characters.

By default, the following control characters are NOT allowed in passwords:
	control-c control-d control-h control-j control-m
	control-o control-r control-s control-q control-y
	control-z control-\ control-[ control-] DELETE

These are typical tty special characters on UCB-derived UNIX systems.
A user could put these characters in their password by quoting them
with control-v, but there is no guarantee that the tty modes
set by login(1) would allow them to be properly entered, so they
are best avoided.

This table may be replaced or supplimented via the configuration file.

* About checkpasswd....

The checking routine is table driven (in checkpasswd.c) so that new routines
can be added easily.

I did not use some other password check routines that have been made available
because they rejected many passwords which I thought was reasonable.  These
checks are concerned with filtering out words that might be easily guessed.
I believe that my tests, especially the dictionary lookup, perform this
function.  Checks can be inserted or deleted as desired.

This version is much more functional and configurable that the original
subroutine package provided.  I chose to convert the subroutine to a
standalone program that is self-contained and can be executed from other
programs.

Very soon afterwards I realized that the standalone program could be 
refitted to work as a library.  So checkpasswd comes in two forms:
standalone and library.

The standalone program reads from standard input and reports
to standard output.

The library version can be called from a program and will return
1 or 0 depending on whether the password should be used.  It will
also print a diagnostic message to stdout if it does not deem the password
to be desirable.

The routine setcheckpasswd() can be used to set options when using the library.
See checkpasswd(3) about setting options.

* Dictionaries...

I figured that why no password checker to date did dictionary lookups is 
because of the overhead in doing so.  I use a DBM database version of
a dictionary to make the lookups fast.  On my system, the DBM version of
/usr/dict/words takes up only about 800K - worth the space to make
password checking fast.

Since multiple dictionaries can be searched, any new words that you want
to 'take out' of use can be added to one of them.  As an aside, this
is why I just couldn't use the vanilla V7 dbm - it can not handle more
than one database.

The reason for the dictionary checking is to thwart crackers who go through
the system dictionary looking for passwords.  If we prevent people from
choosing passwords which are in publicly readable dictionaries, that
cracking strategy should then fail.

Passwords which use punctuation or control characters or have multiple 
changes of case are not looked up.  Since these would not be found in the
spelling dictionary, there is no reason to look for them.

*** Important note ***
It is a good idea to have dictionary data bases, because using fgrep(1)
to search an ASCII file, the file in which the plaintext passwords are placed
is prey to being read (though precautions have been taken against this).

* How to use checkpasswd...

The standalone checkpasswd is not designed to be an end-user program.
It should be installed in a library directory somewhere and used from
another program.  The -o, -s and -e options are provided to facilitate
such use, and the 'call_ckpasswd.c' module included shows an example of this.

* To do...

Build in some public-domain version of grep so that another process does
not need to be used for looking in flat ASCII files.

* Administrativa...

I have done considerable testing but do not guarantee that this program
is bullet-proof.

There is no copyright on checkpasswd. 

* Building checkpasswd...

1. Edit Makefile and select if DBM is to be used and where to install
   checkpasswd and config file.
2. Do a 'make all'.
3. Use dict/makedict to build DBM dictionaries.

** If you are not using the standalone application version, stop now **

4. Edit checkpasswd.cf to reflect your preferences.
5. Do a 'make install'.
