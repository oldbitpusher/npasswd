		If there is already an npasswd config file in place,
		'make install' will leave it alone.

		To force replacement, do "make install-config".

		It is suggested that if you need a customized config,
		adapt the prototype and maintain it under source control
		(SCCS, RCS) in another directory.

E 2
chfn.help	Help file for chfn (empty)
chsh.help	Help file for chfn (empty)
passwd.help	Help file for passwd (provided)

chsh.motd	Message of the day for chsh (empty)
chfn.motd	Message of the day for chfn (empty)
passwd.motd	Message of the day for passwd (empty)

	An example "message of the day" would be notice of update latency 
	(e.g. how long until the next NIS map update is done).

Customize these files then do "make install"
