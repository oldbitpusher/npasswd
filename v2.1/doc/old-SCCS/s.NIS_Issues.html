<h2>Npasswd and password aging</h2>
<p>
Here is what I understand about password aging (Solaris / System 5 style).
<p> 
Concepts:
<ul>
<li>Solaris (and some versions of Linux) have centralized many administrative
    functions into Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAMs).
<p>
<li>
  The PAM routines do the work of password verification and changing.
 <p>
  Example: <b>/bin/login</b> calls the <b>pam_unix</b>
module (see <b>/etc/pam.conf</b>) to handle the <b>login</b> service.
 That module prompts the user for a password,
  figures out from <b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b> which backend
  (<b>/usr/lib/nss_XXX.so</b>) to load to find the user information.
</ul>
<p>
 <h3> From Solaris 7 man page <i>shadow</i>(4):</h3>
<blockquote> 
       <b>/etc/shadow</b> is an access-restricted ASCII system  file  that
       stores  users'  encrypted passwords and related information.
       The shadow file can be used in conjunction with other shadow
       sources,   including   the   NIS   maps   passwd.byname  and
       passwd.byuid and the NIS+ table <b>passwd</b>.  Programs  use  the
       <i>getspnam</i>(3C) routines to access this information.
<pre>
       The fields are
  
       lastchg   The number of days between January 1, 1970, and
                 the date that the password was last modified.
       min       The minimum number of days required between password changes.
       max       The maximum number of days the password is valid.
       warn      The number of days before password expires that
                 the user is warned.
       inactive  The number of days of inactivity allowed for that user.
       expire    An absolute date specifying when login may no longer be used.
</pre>
</blockquote> 
  
<h3>My comments</h3>
  
<P>
  If <tt>((current-time - lastchg) &gt; max)</tt>
the password has expired and the module performs a password change.
The calling program knows nothing of this.
The <b>passwd</b> program is <b>not</b> invoked, hence <b>npasswd</b>
cannot be inserted in the process.
<p> 
Npasswd does the following:
<ul> 
<li> Updates <b>lastchg</b> to mark when it changed the password.
<li> Checks <b>min</b> to enforce minimal password age.
<li> Does <b>not</b> check <b>max</b>,
except to disallow changes under some conditions.
<li> Invokes the vendor <b>passwd</b> program to change aging for a password.
</ul>
<p> 
<h2>Npasswd, NIS and password aging</h2>
<p>
Password aging parameters are not included in the passwd file format,
though the definition for <b>struct passwd</b> has a <b>pw_age</b>
element, there it has no field in <b>/etc/passwd</b>.
There can be no password aging without supplimental information.
<p>
This supplimental information is in <b>/etc/shadow</b>,
along with the encrytped password.
When NIS maps are built, the encrypted password is taken from
shadow entries and included in the <b>passwd.byname</b> and
<b>passwd.byuid</b> maps.
The format of these maps <b>do not</b> include the aging information.
<p>
<font size=+2>
This means that password aging <b>is not available</b> on NIS clients.</font>
<p>
From Volume 1 of <i>Solaris 8 System Administration Guide</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
	If you are using <b>NIS+</b> or the <b>/etc</b> files to store user
	account information, you can set up password aging on a
	user's password.
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no password aging if you use NIS.
If you are running
NIS in C2 security mode, you get the NIS map <b>passwd.adjunct.byname</b>
which does contain a password aging field, but it is not used.
<p>

<h2>Changing passwords on NIS clients</h2>
<P>
From the manual page for <i>yppasswd</i>(1m):
<p>
<blockquote>
	Entries in the <b>passwd</b>, <b>shadow</b> or
<b>passwd.adjunct</b>  files  are  only 
	changed  if  the  password presented by <i>yppasswd</i>(1) matches the
	encrypted  password  of the  entry.
</blockquote>
<p>
From <i>/usr/include/rpcsvc/yppasswd.h</i>:
<pre>
	struct yppasswd {
		char *oldpass;          /* old (unencrypted) password */
		struct passwd newpw;    /* new pw structure */
	};
</pre>
<p>
If npasswd detects that it is running on a NIS client
<tt>(hostname != NIS master for passwd.byname)</tt>,
or does not find the passwd entry in any
of the files in its list (but did get it from NIS), it will use the
RPC interface to make the passwd change.
<p>
As detailed above, the RPC interface <b>requires</b>
the current password be provided
in cleartext.  The yppasswd daemon will only work if this is given (or the
target entry has a null password).
<p>
Npasswd makes the assumption that if root is changing someone else's password
on a NIS client, it is because the current password is unknown.  In that
case,  <b>the password CANNOT be changed via the RPC interface</b>.  The only
place to change an unknown password is the NIS master.
<p>
One could fault npasswd for being pendantic on this point.  
My experience as a system administrator
is that when I am changing a users' password as root, it is because the user
does not know it,  hence I must make the change on the
NIS master, then run the "YP make" to update the maps so the user can login.
<p>
The bottom line is that substantial user management (e.g. password changes)
needs to be done <b>on the NIS master</b>.
<p>
<h2>Password files on NIS masters</h2>
<p>
During the process of customizing npasswd,
the <i>Configure</i> script probes the system for password files.
This list is presented and the builder is offered the option of changing it.
<P>
In the process of looking for a user entry, npasswd examines <b>every</b>
file in this list.  If the user is found and the entry is not
an NIS stub (e.g. <tt>+user::0:0:::</tt>),
then that file is marked as the source
for the entry and the password field will be changed in that file.  
<P>
Should the user not be found in any of the local files, then NIS is
searched.  If the user is found in NIS, then that service is marked as the
source and the password will be changed via the RPC mechanism
as described above.
<P>
When a file other than <b>/etc/passwd</b> is used as the NIS map source,
that file must be in included in the password file list.
<P>
For example, if your NIS map is built from <b>/var/yp/src/passwd</b>,
then that file must be in npasswd's internal file list.
<P>
If you attempt to change a local password on the NIS master 
and get the message "<b>Information can only be changed on NIS master</b>",
then you need to redo the password file list.
<P>
To do this, run <tt>"Configure -d"</tt> and when
prompted "<tt>Change passwd file list?</tt>" reply 'y' and enter the path to 
your NIS passwd master file.   Then rebuild and install npasswd.
