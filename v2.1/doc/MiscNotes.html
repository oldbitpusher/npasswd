<P>
<H3>SunOS 4 (Solaris 1)</H2>

<UL>
Support for SunOS 4 is still included, but I have ceased development.
Secure RPC and adjunct passwords are supported, though not thoroughly tested.
<I>Npasswd</I> will build with either the standard (/usr/ucb/cc) compiler
or the Sun (/usr/lang/acc) compiler.

</UL>

<H3> SunOS 5 (Solaris 2)</H3>

<UL>
<P>
<I>Npasswd</i> <B>does not</B> support NIS+.
<P>
Getting passwords out of
NIS+ is easy, and even updating them is straightforward.
NIS+ credentials are complicated to manage.
<P>
It is possible but not a good idea to have the login
password and the NIS+ key phrase be different.  Hence, when
the login password is changed, the key phrase should be  updated.
The API for doing this has changed in every version of Solaris, and was
undocumented.
<P>
There is an application which does this (nisaddcred), but either
takes the key phrase from the command line or reads it from /dev/tty.
Neither choice is suitable for use by <i>npasswd</i>.
</UL>

<H3> Digital UNIX (aka OSF/1) 3 and 4</H3>

<UL>Support for enhanced security is included, though it has
not been extensively
tested.  Do <b>not</b> interchange binaries between Digital UNIX versions
3 and 4 - the shadow password structure is different.
</UL>

<H2> AIX 4</H2>

<UL>
<P>
Support for shadow passwords is included, but has been only lightly tested.

<P>AIX 4.1 has many password restrictions which can be set per-user or
system wide.  These include lexical requirements, dictionary searches
(though not nearly as vigorous that done by <I>npasswd</I>) and a
hook for external password check modules.  Judicious use  of
these restrictions should result in passwords which are harder to crack.
<P>
You may desire to tune these password restrictions first <B>before</B>
converting to <I>npasswd</I>.

<P>The words lists from this distribution could be used as password check 
dictionaries.

<P>There are a number of other password restrictions available on AIX 4,
and a password history mechanism, none of which are supported by
<I>npasswd</I>.

<P>
</UL>
 
<H3>HP-UX</H3>

<UL>
The support for HP-UX
enhanced security was contributed by Mike Stute (mstute@compucom.com).
I do not have a HP-UX system available to verify these changes or fix bugs.
</UL>

<H3>IRIX</H3>

<UL>
Works under IRIX 6.3.  The <B>-Wl,-w</B> compiler option 
is needed to suppress superfluous loader warning messages.
</UL>

<H2> Password history</H2>

<UL>The code which maintains password history in a NIS map is untested.
This can only
be used if Secure RPC is being used (e.g. SunOS 4 system with C2 security
active).
<P>
Password history in a NIS map (or NIS+ table) would work much better
for a cluster, rather than sharing a history file with NFS.  One
approach would be to define an RPC service to query and update
password history, and provide a daemon, which would be
started at boot time on the system having the password file.
</UL>

<H2>Enhanced security support</H2>
<UL>
<P>
The major UNIX vendors have security facilities which
<b>should</b> facilitate the development of programs
such as <i>npasswd</i>.
The mechanisms are often complex, sometimes the API is not
well documented, nor is sample code available.
<P>
Hence, <I>npasswd</I> makes minimal use of such facilities.
</UL>
