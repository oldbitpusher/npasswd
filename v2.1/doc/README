                  Npasswd Documentation README
  
This is the on-line documentation for npasswd. Most of the documentation is
in HTML, but is plain enough that any Web browser (including lynx) can
display it. Start at "index.html".

Other documents of interest:

Utah-WormTour.me    University of Utah paper on Morris worm (nroff me form)
Worm-Utah.ps        University of Utah paper on Morris worm (PostScript)
Worm-MIT.ps         MIT paper on Morris worm (PostScript)
PasswordSecurity.ps CMU paper on password security (PostScript)

checkpassword.1     Manual page for checkpassword program
checkpassword.3     Manual page for checkpassword library
history_admin.1     Manual page for history_admin
makedict.1          Manual page for makedict
npasswd.1           Manual page for npasswd


These files are included in the distribution, but the Makefile will attempt
to derive them files from the HTML and NROFF sources. 

.txt	Text versions of HTML documents.  These are generated by using
	the 'lynx' browser.

.catN	Text versions of man pages.  These are for systems which do not
	have nroff.

_N.html	HTML versions of man pages (e.g. checkpassword_1.html)
