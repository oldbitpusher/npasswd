.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Npasswd
changes the login password, login shell or finger information for a user.
It is designed to supplement or replace the standard password change
programs 
.BR passwd , 
.B chfn
and
.BR chsh .
.PP
.B Npasswd
addresses some common deficiencies of standard
password change programs.  It supports local passwd
(and shadow) files, NIS maps, and enhanced security shadow databases
for HP-UX and Digital Unix (aka OSF/1).
.PP
New passwords are subjected to a series of 
stringent guessability checks to decrease the chance of users
choosing vulnerable passwords.
.PP
When called as "\fBchfn\fP",
.B npasswd
changes the finger information associated with your user name or the specified
user name.  
.PP
When called as "\fBchsh\fP",
.B npasswd
changes the login shell of your user name or the specified user name.  
.PP
Only the super-user can change the password, finger information or shell
of another user.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Every version of 
.B passwd
supports a different set of command line options.
.B Npasswd
supports a subset of these for a few platforms.
It attempts to recognize the other vendor-specific options and defer to
the vendor-supplied program to handle them.
This list may be incomplete.

.RE
.TP 10
.B \-\^XF
Suppress new password checking.
This option is restricted to root and should be used very sparingly.
.TP 10
.B \-\^Xf

.TP 10
.B \-\^XI
Allow standard input to be a file or pipe.
This option can be used thusly:

.fi
.sp
This option is restricted to root.
.RE
.TP 10
.B \-\^Xs
Change login shell.
.TP 10
.B \-\^XV
Print version and patch level information.
.SH FILES
@NPASSWD-HOME@/npasswd \- The executable
.br
@NPASSWD-HOME@/passwd.conf \- Configuration file
.br
@NPASSWD-DICT@ \- Default dictionary collection
.br
@NPASSWD-HIST@ \- Default password history database
.SH "SEE ALSO"
@NPASSWD-UTIL@/history_admin \- password history administration utility
.br
@NPASSWD-DOCS@/index.html \- Npasswd Reference Manual (HTML format)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Many and hopefully fairly self-explanatory.
.SH BUGS
A substantial section of the password check code
is very specific to English.
.PP
No attempt has been made to internationalize the program.
.PP
Some platforms (e.g. Sun, Digital Unix) have elaborate security
facilities.  Few of these are used by
.BR npasswd ,
mostly because the APIs are not documented.
.PP
For historical reasons, there is support for two obsolete operating
systems - SunOS 4 and Ultrix 4.
This code will removed from any future revisions.
