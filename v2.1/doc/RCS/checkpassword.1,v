.SH NAME
checkpassword \- check passwords for guessability
.SH SYNOPSIS

] [
.B \-\^u

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Checkpassword
reads passwords from the standard input and subjects them to suitability tests.
It purposely does
.B not
take a password argument since process arguments are displayed by
.IR ps (1).
.PP
.I Checkpassword
reads passwords from the standard input and
\fBdoes not\fP suppress character echo.
The standard input can be redirected from a pipe or file, which facilitates
being called by a program or script.
.PP
.I Checkpassword
exits with 0 if the password was suitable. Otherwise a message is
sent to standard output and exit status is 1.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-\^c
Take the next argument as the configuration file to read.
.I Checkpassword
uses the same configuration file as
.IR npasswd ,
ignoring directives that do not apply.
Consult the manual page for
.I npasswd
for help with the configuration directives.
.TP 10
.B \-\^o
Test one password and exit with check status.
.TP 10
.B \-\^u
Take the next argument as the user (user name or numeric uid)
to use for password checking.
This option is restricted to the super-user.
.TP 10
.BI \-\^XD N
Set internal debugging level to N.
.sp
Debug levels are:
.RS
.TP 10

.TP 10
config
Trace configuration file processing.
.TP 10
pwcheck

.TP 10

More detailed tracing.
.TP 10

.PP
This option may be restricted to root.
.RE
.TP 10
.B \-\^Xh

.TP 10
.B \-\^XV

.SH BUGS
.B Checkpassword
does not run with privileges, and the
.B npasswd
history database is protected from general access.
This effectively disables the \fIpassword history\fP check.
.PP
On Digital UNIX systems,
.B checkpassword
can be setgid to group 
.I auth
to access the shadow database.
.PP
See the \fINpasswd Administration Guide\fP for details.
