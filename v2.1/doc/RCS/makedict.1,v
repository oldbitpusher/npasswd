.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Makedict
builds the hashed dictionaries used by
.BR npasswd .
The dictionary hash files are built from \fIword lists\fP, which
are text files with one word per line.
.PP
Three hashed files are created with the suffixes \fB.hwm\fP, \fB.pwd\fP, and \fB.pwi\fP .
.PP
.B Packer
is a low-level utility which reads words (one per line) from standard
input and packs them into hash files.
.B Makedict
is a smart front-end to 
.BR packer ,
and is the preferred tool for dictionary building.
.PP
.B Unpacker
dumps dictionary hashes to standard output, one word per line.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options for
.BR makedict .
.TP
.BI \-\^o " output"
Create the dictionary 
.BR output .
.TP
.BI \-\^m " source"
Merge in words in dictionary
.BR source .
.TP
.BI \-\^T " temp"
Use 
.B temp
as the temporary directory for sorting.  Use this option if the default
temporary directory used by
.IR sort (1)
is small.
.TP
.I words ... words
Word lists. Compressed files (ending with \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP) can be used.
.PP
.B Packer
and 
.B unpacker
take one argument \- the name of the dictionary file to pack or unpack.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To make the dictionary 'my-dict':
.RS
.nf
makedict -o my-dict word-list-1 ... word-list-n
.fi
.sp
Will produce the files \fBmy-dict.pwd\fP,
\fBmy-dict.pwi\fP and \fBmy-dict.hwm\fP.
.RE
.PP
To add words to an existing dictionary:
.RS
.nf
makedict -o existing-dict -m existing-dict word-list-1 ... word-list-n
.fi
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 5
Missing option to -o
No output file was specified.
.TP 5
Missing option to -T
No temporary directory was specified.
.TP 5
Missing option to -m
No merge dictionary was specified.
.TP 5
Empty or missing hash file \fIname\fP
One of the dictionary hash files came up empty, either because the
sources were empty or a filesytem error occurred.
.SH BUGS
The input to
.B packer
.B must
.B be
.BR sorted ,
else the result hash files will be faulty.  Use 
.B makedict
instead.
