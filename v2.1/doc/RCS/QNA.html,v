<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">

<P><B>Q.</B> My system has shadow passwords.  Why would I need <I>npasswd</I>?
<P><B>A.</B> Shadow passwords makes it <B>harder</B> for a bad guy
to obtain encrypted passwords.  But that protection is a function of
the UNIX file system.  There are a number of "root kits" available
for intruders to gain super-user privileges on your system so
they can get a copy of your password and shadow files.
<P>Combining intelligent password checking with a shadow database provides
the best protection short of one-time use passwords or challenge/response
smart card systems. 
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P><B>Q.</B> Is npasswd compatible with the passwd program supplied by my system
vendor?
<P><B>A.</B> The basic functionality of the passwd program (changing passwords)
is the same.  However, many vendor passwd programs
have specialty options that npasswd does not. This is usually because the
option is ill-documented or very esoteric and a hard
to replicate. The <I>npasswd</I> installation procedure will
preserve the vendor programs in the npasswd installation directory.
These programs will be invoked to do what <I>npasswd</I> cannot.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH=50%>
<P> <B>Q.</B> Are there npasswd binaries that I can drop in?
<P> <B>A.</B> <I>Npasswd</I> is distributed in source for the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI>
There are customizations which must be chosen at compilation time.
I consider these options important for the installer 
to be aware of, even though they probably will not need to be changed.</LI>
<LI>
I did not want to arbitrarily decide where you want to install <I>npasswd</i>.
You have the option of changing the default
to suit your needs.  For example, the location of the password
history database is dependent upon system configuration.
</UL>
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH=50%>
<P> <B>Q.</B> How much do I need to know to build and install npasswd?
<P> <B>A.</B> A lot of work has gone into making npasswd easier to build,
install and maintain. However, this is not a "turn the crank and go" process.
You should be familiar with your C compiler and <I>make</I>.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH=50%>
<P> <B>Q.</B> What support is available?
<P> <B>A.</B> Bug reports will be investigated on a time-available basis.
See the <A HREF="Support.html"><B>Npasswd Support Guide</B></A>.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH=50%>
<P><B>Q.</B> Is there any maintenance required?
<P> <B>A.</B> The password history database must be purged periodically.  
Use the <I>history_admin</i> program for this purpose.
See <A HREF="history_admin_1.html"><I>history_admin</I>(1)</A>.

<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<BR> <B>Q.</B> Can I use Crack dictionaries with npasswd?
<P> <B>A.</B> Yes, but not directly.  The dictionary hash format used by Crack
is optimized to conserve disk space. The <i>npasswd</i> dictionary hash format
is optimized for lookup speed.
Crack dictionaries can be converted for use by <I>npasswd</I>.
<P>
See the <A HREF="AdminGuide.html"><B>Npasswd Administration Guide</B></A>
for the conversion procedure.

</UL>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P> <B>Q.</B> How many dictionaries do I need or want?
<P> <B>A.</B> As many as you can stand. You can have multiple
dictionaries, each generated from a distinct word list, or one large combined
dictionary.  A number of smaller dictionaries allows easier customization
than one big dictionary.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P> <B>Q.</B> How does the size of my dictionaries affect password security?

<P> <B>A.</B> More dictionary words equals greater password security.
It may also mean greater frustration in your user community because
<i>npasswd</i> will reject more passwords.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P> <B>Q.</B> Why are there words in the dictionary which are shorter than the
minimum password length?  Wouldn't it save disk space to remove these short
words from the dictionaries?
<P> <B>A.</B> Several permutations are made on each dictionary word. 
For example, "quick" is too short to be a password, (minimum length is 6),
but "quickly" is long enough and would be found
by the test of the plural form of the word "quick" from the dictionary.
If bad guys have "quick" in their Crack dictionaries, and you don't -
your system can be in trouble.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P> <B>Q.</B> Why is npasswd so picky about accepting passwords?
<P> <B>A.</B> Because the bad guys who are trying to get your passwords are using
some very thorough tools like Crack.  The dictionary check code in
npasswd was written by the author of Crack, and performs the same checks. 
Given sufficient dictionaries, if <i>npasswd</i> accepts a password there is a
good chance that Crack will not guess it.
<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="50%">
<P> <B>Q.</B> What kind of passwords <B>will</B> <i>npasswd</i> accept?
<P> <B>A.</B> A mixture of upper and lower case alphas,
with a sprinkling of punctuation
characters and digits will usually pass muster.  Control  and
whitespace characters can also be included, but should be used with caution
- some applications which read passwords may not deal with these very well.

I have a limited variety of UNIX platforms available for porting and testing.
The more specific the bug report, the better chance of getting a fix.
