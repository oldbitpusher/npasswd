README for AIX 4.1 $Date$

AIX 4.1 has a number of password restrictions which can be set per user 
or system wide.  These include lexical requirements and dictionary searches
(though not nearly as vigorous that that done by npasswd).  Judicious use
of these restrictions should result in passwords which are harder to crack.

If you are having problems with cracked passwords on AIX 4 systems,
I suggest that you tune the system password restrictions first *before*
converting to npasswd.   Experience has shown me that it is better to make the
vendor stuff work where possible.

The plaintext dictionaries in this distribution could perhaps be added to the
'dictionlist' field of the default stanza in "/etc/security/user".

I have not experimented with these facilities, so I don't know if they
really work :-)

Npasswd DOES NOT support any of the password restrictions listed below.
The "only root can change this password" and "force change on next
login" flags (not mentioned below) ARE supported.

------------------- Excerpt for 'man passwd' on AIX 4.1

Construct locally defined passwords according to the password restrictions
in the /etc/security/user configuration file. This file contains the
following restrictions:

minalpha	Specifies the minimum number of alphabetic characters.

minother	Specifies the minimum number of other characters.

minlen		Specifies the minimum number of characters.

		*Note:	This value is determined by either the minalpha
		value plus the minother value or the minlen value,
		whichever is greater.

mindiff		Specifies the minimum number of characters in the new password
		that are not in the old password.

		*Note: This restriction does not consider position. If the
		new password is abcd and the old password is edcb,
		the number of different characters is 1.

maxrepeats	Specifies the maximum number of times a single character
		can be used in a password.

minage		Specifies the minimum age at which a password can be changed.
		Passwords must be kept for a minimum period. This value
		is measured in weeks.

maxage		Specifies the maximum age of a password. A password must be
		changed after a specified amount of time measured in weeks.

maxexpired	Specifies the maximum number of weeks beyond the maxage
		value that a password can be changed by the user.

histexpire	Specifies the number of weeks that a user cannot reuse
		a password.

histsize	Specifies the number of previous passwords that the user
		cannot reuse.

dictionlist	Specifies the list of dictionary files checked when a
		password is changed.

pwdchecks	Specifies the list of external password restriction methods
		invoked when a password is changed.

For all of the idiosyncrasies of AIX, IBM got this one right - a way to set
lexical requirements, search dictionaries and provide a hook for inserting
local code into the password check process.  Other vendors need to learn
this lesson - especially Sun.

It is possible that I will have a password check module which can be inserted
into the local check hook later.

Npasswd DOES NOT support any of the password restrictions listed below, nor
are the other administrative restrictions honored.
