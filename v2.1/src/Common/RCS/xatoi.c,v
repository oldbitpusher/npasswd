 * xatoi
 *	Smart 'atoi' which recognizes decimal, octal and hex constants.
 * Usage:
 *	status = xatoi(string, &end-ptr, &rval);
 *
 * <string> can be one of:
 *	[-]DD	= decimal number (with optional minus sign)
 *	[-]0ooo	= octal number (with optional minus sign)
 *	[-]0fxx	= hexidecimal number (with optional minus sign)
 *
 * <end-ptr>
 *	Pointer to place in <string> where first non-numeric found
 *	May be null
 *
 * <rval>
 *	Stash location for decoded value
 *
 * Returns:
 *	1 if conversion successful
 *	0 if conversion error or nothing found
