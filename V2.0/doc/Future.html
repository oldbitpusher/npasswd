<P>
The rewrite of the 1998 version of <i>npasswd</i> was 
more complicated and took me over 5 years of off and on work.  During that time
all the systems at  the UT Austin Computation Center
which hosted the original <i>npasswd</i> were retired.
<p>
In their place came new hardware (64-bit CPUs), with
new operating systems (Solaris 2, OSF/1), and new user databases (NIS+).
<P>
Said user databases are often sophisticated, but too often
suffered from unstable and/or undocumented programming interfaces
and raised difficult bugs to work around.
See the commentary on NIS+ support in the <A href="FAQ.html#_NISplus">FAQ</a>.
<p>
Manipulating these databases is much more complex
than updating field 2 of <B>/etc/passwd</B>.
<p>
We decided upon a policy of periodically running <i>Crack</i> against our
password files and deactivating users with bad passwords by changing their
login shell to a script that informs the user to call our Help Desk to get their
account working again.  This approach obviated the need for <i>npasswd</i> to
work on these new systems. The upshot of this is, sorry to say,
that <i>npasswd</i> is not in use on our systems, removeing a considerable
incentive for continued development.
<P>
On the bright side some vendor <i>passwd</i> programs are better at disallowing
easily guessed passwords.  Combined with shadow passwords, this approach
provides <b>some</b> insulation against typical password guessing attacks. 
See the commentary on shadow passwords in the <A href="FAQ.html#_shadow">FAQ</a>.
<P>
Today the greatest vulnerability for UNIX systems is not login via guessed passwords,
but remote root access attacks on network services - usually stack overflows due
to malicious input data.  Why spend time cracking passwords when you can run
a root kit and own the machine within seconds?
<p>
Still it is prudent (and sometimes mandatory under regulation or law) to 
prevent users from picking dumb passwords.  This need will become more acute
in the area of Web services.
<p>
UNIX vendors could make the systems administrators life
more pleasant by allowing the interposition of a site-specific password acceptance policy.

<H2>The future - specifics</H2></A>
<div class=para>
<p>
The work of keeping up with new releases of UNIX systems with new features
can take up a lot of time which I do not have.  For example there are many
different Linux distributions on the market (and Internet), and the authentication
functionality appears to differ between them.  To properly detect and support
these features requires access to resources and development time that continues
to be in short supply.
<p>
Therefore I rely upon the members
of the Internet community to help <i>npasswd</i> work on more platforms. 
<P>
With the advent of new authentication service structures such as
the <i>name service switch</i>, vendor utilities for user account manipulation
have changed from monolith, know-everything do-everything programs (like <i>npasswd</i>)
to mostly a dispatcher to run-time loaded modules to do the actual work.
The Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) architecture and the name service switch
are common examples of this approach.  See the section on password aging in the 
<A href=FAQ.html#_aging">FAQ</a> for a discussion of how PAM works.
<p>
Since much of the heavy lifting is done in run-time
loaded code, two approaches emerge for the evolution of <i>npasswd</i>:
<ol>
<li> Have <i>npasswd</i> detect the presence of such features and use them
for updating the user data.
<li>
Make the vendor programs load the password checking component of <i>npasswd</i>.
</ol>
<p>
The second approach is ultimately better for it allows using the vendor-supplied
user management utilities, thus avoiding problems with patching and upgrades.  This
requires considerable work to transform the password check engine into a PAM library.
Thankfully this has been contributed by Victor Burns of Texas Instruments.
<p>
Future versions of <i>npasswd</i> will probably be structured about the 
shared library concept.
The preferred configuration
will be to use password checking engine as a PAM module which can be inserted 
in the password management stack.  The standalone program would only be
created on systems without PAM.
