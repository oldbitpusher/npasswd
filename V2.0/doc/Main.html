<H2>Introduction</H2>

<div class=para>
<P>
<I>Npasswd</I> is a replacement for the UNIX <i>passwd</i> command.
It subjects user passwords to stringent guessability checks to decrease
the chance of users choosing vulnerable passwords. It addresses
other deficiencies found of standard password change programs.
<P>
<I>Npasswd</I> may also replace the programs <I>chfn </I>and <I>chsh</I>.
<P>
<I>Npasswd</I> should work under UNIX flavored operating systems.
It can not not replicate every feature of every <i>passwd</I>
program on every UNIX platform.  If you choose to replace
the vendor passwd utilities with <I>npasswd</I>,
the vendor utilties will be preserved 
and may used to perform the functions that <i>npasswd</i> cannot do.
This functionality is platform dependant.
<P>
Many UNIX platforms use shadow passwords, which makes it harder for a
bad guy to obtain encrypted passwords. 
This <b>greatly reduces</b> your vulnerability to password crackers,
but if you use unsecure
NIS or have a misconfigured user database, you can still
give away your passwords.
<P>
Combining intelligent password checking with a shadow database provides
the best protection short of one-time use passwords or challenge/response
smart card systems.
<P>
Configuring <I>npasswd</I> requires some thought on the part of the
administrator. It's not a "plug and play" process. Many configuration
options are available and code contains policies that require local customization.

<H2> History </H2>
<div class=para>
<P>
In November of 1988 the infamous Morris Worm escaped its playpen and
went on a rampage across the Internet, bringing UNIX systems to their
knees and causing widespread trouble. Among the Worm's attacks was a password
guesser which was fairly clever and unnervingly successful. </P>
<P>
Many of our systems escaped being ravaged by the Worm
because our main mail gateway at the time was neither a VAX nor a SUN.
<P>
Afterwards the Worm was dissected and papers released describing its
anatomy. From these I replicated its password cracker, ran it against
our password files and got plenty of hits. I rewrote the cracker into
a primitive password checker that was posted to <I>comp.sources.misc</I>
in 1989.
<P>
The UNIX password encryption <I>crypt</I>(3) was considered hard enough
to crack, so it was deemed safe to have encrypted passwords visible to all.
The Morris Worm invalidated this assumption.
<P>
The Worm approached password cracking from a &quot;human engineering&quot;
perspective. People are likely to choose passwords which are easy to remember
- such as their login name or phone number. The Worm's password cracker
encrypted various plaintext strings and compared them to the encrypted
password. The plaintext came from other <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> fields and
the UNIX spelling dictionary. This approach was fairly successful.
<P>
UNIX vendors were shipping the primitive V7 <i>passwd</i> program
which did no significant password validation. This
meant the only way to have more secure passwords was to replace the
<i>passwd</i> program.
I wrote <I>npasswd</I> around my "worm" password checker.
<P>
By late 1989 <I>npasswd</I> had replaced <tt>/bin/passwd</tt> on all of
our public UNIX systems. After a few sweeps with my password checker, some
pointed email and other unfriendly actions, I and my colleagues
breathed easier - at least for awhile.
<P>
Around 1991 Alec Muffet relased <I>Crack</I> and the world changed. It did
not attempt to reverse the password encryption, but used a brute force
attack similar to that of the Worm.  Anyone with a 386 box (the hot
commodity system of the time), a C compiler and some patience could
crack encrypted passwords at their leisure.
<P>
I began to look into integrating <I>Crack</I> into <I>npasswd</I>.
I found that <I>npasswd</I> needed serious
updating - the UNIX environment was changing, and there had been plenty
of porting problems.
<P>
I had also learned a lot more about C programming, so I decided that
<I>npasswd</I> needed an extensive rewrite.  That work started in July of 1993, and version 2 of <i>npasswd</i> is the result.

<H2>Acknowledgments</H2>
<p>
<div class=para>
<P>
A lot of people have contributed their work to <I>npasswd </I>over the
years. I've got a large collection of variants of npasswd 1 done by lots
of folks. Many have provided good ideas and code that have been incorporated
into version 2.0.
<P>
Here are some of the more outstanding contributors that I can recall:
<UL>
<p>
Alec Muffet for providing a modular <I>Crack</I> program easily adapted
and a copious collection of dictionary words.
<p>
Paul Leyland of Oxford University, UK provided support for Ultrix enhanced
security - which was the base for OSF/1 enhanced security support.
<p>
Donnie Emeson for adding character class diversity requirements
to the password lexical check code.
<p>
Mike Stute for HP-UX support and some improvements to the dictionary
lookup password checking.
<p>
One of the most popular variants of <I>npasswd</I> version 1 was
produced at NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Two guys who did a lot
of the JPL work were Dan Kegel, who added Crack password checking and Dave
Hayes who added SunOS 4 adjunct password support (among other things).
<p>
Tomasz Surmacz, Institute of Cybernetics, Technical Technical University
of Wroclaw, Poland, contributed the password original history code.
<P>
Charles Seeger, University of Florida CIS Department and Steve
Swartz, University of Wisconsin for supplying code to include <I>chfn</I> and
<I>chsh</I> functionality.
<p>
Victor Burns of Texas Instruments for converting the password check engine
into a Pluggable Authentication Module.  Thanks also to TI for letting him
distribute his code.
</UL>
<P>
There are many more who made suggestions and provided code that wasn't
used, but whose comments were appreciated.
