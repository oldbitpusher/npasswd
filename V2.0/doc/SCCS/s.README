These files are included in the distribution, but the Makefile will attempt
to derive them files from the HTML and NROFF sources. 

.txt	Text versions of HTML documents.  These are generated by using
	the 'lynx' browser.

.catN	Text versions of man pages.  These are for systems which do not
	have nroff.

_N.html	HTML versions of man pages (e.g. checkpassword_1.html)
