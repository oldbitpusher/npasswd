<H2><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P><I>Npasswd</I> is a replacement for the passwd command for UNIX.
It subjects user passwords to stringent guessability checks to decrease
the chance of users choosing vulnerable passwords. It addresses
other deficiencies found of standard password change programs.

<I>Npasswd</I> is designed to replace the
D 7
programs <I>passwd</I>, <I>chfn </I>and <I>chsh.</I>
E 7
I 7
programs <I>passwd</I>, <I>chfn </I>and <I>chsh</I>.
E 7

<P><I>Npasswd</I> should work under most versions of UNIX and UNIX-like
operating systems. It does not replicate every feature of every password
program on every UNIX platform.  If the installer chooses to replace
the system programs with <I>npasswd</I>, they will be preserved 
and used to perform the functions that <i>npasswd</i> cannot do.

<P>Many UNIX platforms use shadow passwords, which makes it harder for a
bad guy to obtain encrypted passwords. But there are still plenty of systems
which have the encrypted passwords available for all the world to see.
</P>

<P>Having shadow passwords in and of itself <b>greatly reduces</b>
vulnerability to password crackers.
But that protection is a function of the UNIX file system. If you use unsecure
NIS or a misconfigured NIS+, you can still give away your passwords. </P>

<P>Combining intelligent password checking with a shadow database provides
the best protection short of one-time use passwords or challenge/response
smart card systems. </P>

<P>Configuring <I>npasswd</I> requires some thought on the part of the
administrator. It's not a "plug and play" process. There are configuration
options to select, and there is policy in the code that may not meet your
needs. </P>

<H2><A NAME="History"></A>History </H2>

<P>In November of 1988 the infamous Morris worm escaped its playpen and
went on a rampage across the Internet, bringing UNIX systems to their
knees and causing widespread trouble. Among the Worm's attacks was a password
guesser, which was fairly clever and unnervingly successful. </P>

<P>Our systems (University of Texas Academic Computing Servies)
E 8
escaped being ravaged by the Worm
E 7
because our main mail gateway was not a VAX or SUN. </P>

<P>Afterwards the Worm was dissected and papers released describing its
anatomy. From these papers I replicated the password cracker, ran it against
our password files and got plenty of hits. I rewrote the cracker into
a primitive password checker that was posted to <I>comp.sources.misc</I>
in 1989. </P>

<P>The UNIX password encryption <I>crypt</I>(3) was considered good
that the cyphertext could not be cracked, so it was safe to 
have the encrypted passwords visible to all.

<P>The Worm approached password cracking from a &quot;human engineering&quot;
perspective. People are likely to choose passwords which are easy to remember
- such as their login name or phone number. The Worm's password cracker
encrypted various plaintext strings and compared them to the encrypted
password. The plaintext came from user's passwd information and
the UNIX spelling dictionary. This approach was fairly successful. </P>

<P>Our UNIX vendors were shipping the primitive V7 <i>passwd</i> program
which did no significant password checking. This lack of vendor support
meant the only way to have more secure passwords was to replace it.
I wrote <I>npasswd</I> around my "worm" password checker.</P>

<P>By late 1989 <I>npasswd</I> had replaced <B>/bin/passwd</B> on all of
our public UNIX systems. After a few sweeps with my password checker, some
pointed email and other unfriendly actions, I and my colleagues
breathed easier - at least for awhile.

<P>In 1991 (or so) <I>Crack</I> was released and the world changed. It did
not attempt to reverse the password encryption, but used a brute force
attack similar to that of the Worm.  Anyone with a 386 box (the hot
commodity system of the time), a C compiler and some patience could
crack passwords at their leisure.
<P>
I began to look into integrating <I>Crack</I> into <I>npasswd</I>.
I found that <I>npasswd</I> needed serious
updating - the UNIX environment was changing, and there had been plenty
of porting problems. </P>

<P>I had also learned a lot more about C programming, so I decided that
<I>npasswd</I> needed an extensive rewrite.  That work started in July of 1993.

longer than expected.
Since that work started, we have retired all of the UNIX platforms
which hosted the original <i>npasswd</i>.

The rewrite was more complicated and taken over 5 years (off and on).
All of the UNIX platforms which hosted the original <i>npasswd</i> have
have been retired.
E 7
There is new hardware (64-bit CPUs), new operating systems (Solaris 2, OSF/1),
new user databases (NIS+) and security facilities. </P>

<P>These facilities are sophisticated and capable, but too often
have unstable and/or undocumented programming interfaces - as well as difficult
bugs to work around.
D 7
Writing code to manipulate these databases is much more complex
than merely updating field 2 of <B>/etc/passwd.</B> </P>

<P>Although some vendor password change utilities are better at disallowing
easily guessed passwords, most still rely upon file system protections to
keep the cyphertext away from prying eyes. </P>

<P>A lot of people have contributed their work to <I>npasswd </I>over the
years. I've got a large collection of variants of npasswd 1 done by lots
of folks. Many have provided good ideas and code that have been incorporated
into version 2.0.</P>

<P>Here are some of the more outstanding contributors that I can recall:</P>

<P>Alec Muffet for providing me <I>Crack</I> modules ready
to use and a copious collection of word lists.</p>

support).</P>

<P>Donnie Emeson for adding character class diversity requirements
to the password lexical check code.

<P>Mike Stute for HP-UX support and some improvements to the dictionary
lookup password checking.

<P>One of the most popular variants of <I>npasswd</I> was produced at NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Two guys who did a lot
of the JPL work were Dan Kegel, who added Crack password checking and Dave
Hayes who added SunOS 4 adjunct password support (among other things).</P>

<P>Tomasz Surmacz, Institute of Cybernetics, Technical Technical University
of Wroclaw, Poland, contributed the password original history code. </P>
