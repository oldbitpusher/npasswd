<h2>Shadow passwords</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
The standard UNIX passwd format does not provide for the password
meta-data required for password aging. On many modern UNIX-class
systems passwords and meta-data are stored in a shadow password file
(e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/shadow</span>), which
has a more restricted access policy.  This <b>shadow</b> database is where
password aging data is stored.
<p>
<h4> From the Solaris 7 man page shadow(4):</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
       <b>/etc/shadow</b> is an access-restricted ASCII system  file  that
       stores  users'  encrypted passwords and related information.
       The shadow file can be used in conjunction with other shadow
       sources,   including   the   NIS   maps   passwd.byname  and
       passwd.byuid and the NIS+ table <b>passwd</b>.  Programs  use  the
       <i>getspnam</i>(3C) routines to access this information.
</div>
<p>
<I>Npasswd</I> uses a standard API to fetch and update the shadow
password database to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">maintain
the timers needed</span> for password
expiration. Another application must check the timers and enforce
password changes.</li>
</div>
<p> <HR> <p>
<h2>NIS</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
<div class=para>
NIS (aka Yellow Pages) is an extension of the standard UNIX /etc flat data files.
The format of the user authorization data is simple:
<table>
<tr><th>map name</th><th>key</th><th>passwd entry</th></tr>
<tr><td>passwd.byname</td><td>joe</td>
<td><tt>joe:xxxxxxxx:123:456:Joe Nobody:/home/joe:/bin/csh</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>passwd.byuid</td><td>123</td>
<td><tt>joe:xxxxxxxx:123:456:Joe Nobody:/home/joe:/bin/csh</tt></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Nothing from the <b>shadow</b> file is included, hence no password aging information is
available to NIS clients.
<P>
When the NIS maps are built the encrypted password is taken from the
shadow file and included in the NIS maps.
<p>
<a name="_NIS"></a>
<h3>Changing passwords on NIS clients</h3>
<div class=para>

An explanation about how NIS works is in order:
<ul>
<li>The <i>getpwnam</i>(3C)and <i>getpwuid</i>(3C)
routines examine local password files and queries a NIS server
(aka <i>ypserv</i> via <i>ypbind</i>) if needed.
On some platforms there is a <tt>name service switch</tt> 
which allows customization of the lookup process.
This occurs transparently to all
applications using the these interfaces.</li>
<li>Programs that change user information must "look behind the curtain"
and deal explicitly with each name service (e.g. local files, NIS, LDAP,
Kerberos) to locate located where that information resides.
<i>Npasswd</i> consults the <tt>name service switch</tt> and will
read local passwd files and query NIS.</li>
<li>Changing passwd information on NIS client hosts are be done by
issuing a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to a 'password update'
server running on the NIS master host (e.g. <i>rpc.yppasswdd</i>). 
<li>The standard NIS 'passwd' maps reflect the format of the original
UNIX /etc/passwd. Additional user data (e.g. password expiration
flags) are not included. The problem is that the NIS passwd map
was defined before the advent of shadow passwords and cannot be
extended without breaking existing code. To solve the problem a new
NIS map 'passwd.adjunct' was introduced which is backed up by the
'shadow password file'.
<li>
To have shadow passwords NIS must typically be run in 'secure' mode, which
enables <i>getspnam</i>(3C) to
return the encrypted password and the password aging data.
Running NIS in secure mode may require a Secure RPC key infrastructure. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<P>
From the manual page for yppasswd(1m):
<p>
<blockquote>
	Entries in the <b>passwd</b>, <b>shadow</b> or
	<b>passwd.adjunct</b>  files  are  only 
	changed  if  the  password presented by <i>yppasswd</i>(1) matches the
	encrypted  password  of the  entry.
</blockquote>
<p>
From <tt>/usr/include/rpcsvc/yppasswd.h</tt>:
<pre>
	struct yppasswd {
		char *oldpass;          /* old (unencrypted) password */
		struct passwd newpw;    /* new pw structure */
	};
</pre>
<p>
If <i>npasswd</i> detects that it is running on a NIS client
<tt>(hostname != NIS master of passwd.byname)</tt>,
or does not find the passwd entry in any
of the files in its list (but did get it from NIS), it will use the
RPC interface to make the change.
<p>
As detailed above, the RPC interface <b>requires</b> the current password be provided
in cleartext.  The <tt>yppasswd</tt> daemon will only work if this is given (or the
target entry has a null password).
<p>
<i>Npasswd</i> makes the assumption that if root is changing someone else's password
on a NIS client, it is because the current password is unknown.  In that
case,  <b>the password CANNOT be changed via the RPC interface</b>.  The only
place to change an unknown password is the NIS master.
<p>
One could fault <i>npasswd</i> for being pendantic on this point.  
My experience as a system administrator
is that when I am changing a users password as root, it is because the user
does not know it.  So the current password is not available for using with the
RPC interface.  Changes must be done <b>on the NIS master</b>
and the map update procedure invoked.  The <tt>rpc.yppasswdd</tt> service will do this.
</div>
<p>
<h3>Password files on NIS masters</h3>
<div class=para>
<p>
During the process of customizing <i>npasswd</i>,
the <i>Configure</i> script probes the system for password files.
This list is presented and the builder is offered the option of changing it.
<P>
In the process of looking for a user entry, <i>npasswd</i> examines <b>every</b>
file in this list.  If the user is found and the entry is not
an NIS stub (e.g. <tt>+user::0:0:::</tt>),
then that file is marked as the source
for the entry and the password field will be changed in that file.  
<P>
Should the user not be found in any of the local files then NIS is
searched.  If the user is found in NIS, that service is marked as the
source and the password will be changed via the RPC mechanism.
<P>
When a file other than <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> is used as the NIS map source,
that file must be in included in the password file list.
For example, if your NIS map is built from <tt>/var/yp/src/passwd</tt>,
then that file must be in the password file list.
<P>
If you attempt to change a local password on the NIS master 
and get the message "<b>Information can only be changed on NIS master</b>",
then you need to redo the password file list.
<P>
To do this, re-run <tt>"Configure"</tt> and when
prompted "<tt>Change passwd file list?</tt>" reply 'y' and enter the path to 
your NIS passwd master file.  Then rebuild and install <i>npasswd</i>.
<p>
On a NIS master, <i>npasswd</i> can invoke an external post-processing
stage or directly update the DBM format NIS map files.
<P>
</div>
<h3>NIS and shadow passwords</h3>
<div class=para>
<p>
The NIS map format was settled well before the advent of any shadow password convention.
Laster, Sun created an <i>adjunct passwd</i> mechanism to hold the password
ciphertext and age information about the password.
<p>
The NIS map
<b>passwd.adjunct.byname</b> was created to hold this information.  This feature was
only avaialble by running NIS in <b>C2 security mode</b>, which requires Secure RPC
and public / private key infrastructure to authenticate NIS clients.
</div>
</div>

<p> <HR> <p>
<h2>PAM</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
A new authorization structure is to centralize
functions into <b>Pluggable Authentication Modules</b> (PAMs).
<p>
PAM routines typically do the work of user and password verification.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>login</b> program calls the PAM user lookup routine 
for the <b>login</b> service (as specified in <tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt>).
<li>That module prompts the user for a password, then
determines from <b>/etc/pam.conf</b> which backends
(e.g. <b>/usr/lib/security/pam_XXX.so</b>) to load to handle the authorization.
<li>The PAM routine looks up the password,
verifies it and checks the age.
If the password is expired the user may be prompted for a new password.
</ul>
<p>
The PAM approach has changed vendor utilities for password management from monolithic,
know-everything-do-everything programs to mostly a dispatcher to load PAM
modules to do the actual work.
<p>
Future versions of <i>npasswd</i> will probably be structured about the PAM concept.
</div>
<p> <HR> <p>
<h2>Password aging</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
Password age checking can be done by <i>login</i> in one of three ways:</li>
<ol>
<li>Directly with internal code.</li>
<li>Calling <i>passwd</i> with appropriate arguments to check age and
force password change if required. In this case, <i>npasswd</i>
can be inserted into the process by replacing the vendor supplied <i>passwd</i>
program.
<li>Indirectly by calling a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) shared
library module which does the password lookup,
verifies the password and checks the aging flags.
If the password is expired, the user is prompted for a new
password which is stored into the appropriate database. In this
case <i>npasswd</i> cannot be inserted into the process.</li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       The fields are
  
       <b>lastchg</b>   The number of days between January 1, 1970, and
                 the date that the password was last modified.
       <b>min</b>       The minimum number of days required between password changes.
       <b>max</b>       The maximum number of days the password is valid.
       <b>warn</b>      The number of days before password expires that
                 the user is warned.
       <b>inactive</b>  The number of days of inactivity allowed for that user.
       <b>expire </b>   An absolute date specifying when login may no longer be used.
</pre>
<p>
If <tt>((current-time - lastchg) &gt; max)</tt>
the password has expired and the a change is in order.
<p> 
<i>Npasswd</i> does the following:
<ul>
<li> Updates <b>lastchg</b> to mark when it changed the password.
<li> Checks <b>min</b> to enforce minimal password age.
<li> Does <b>not</b> check <b>max</b>, except to disallow changes under some conditions.
<li> Invokes the vendor <b>passwd</b> program to change aging for a password.
</ul>

<H2>Password validation</H2>
<div class=para>
<P>
<I>Npasswd</I> subjects password candidates to a series of validation tests.
The password is accepted only if it passes all of them.

<P>
The available password tests are:
<p>
<H3>History</H3>
<div class=para>
<P>
Password history discourages too frequent password reuse.
Password candidates are compared to the passwords in the users history
and rejected if found. When a password change is done, the encrypted
new password is stored in the history database.
<P>
Access to the history database should be restricted.
However should the history database fall into hostile hands, the security
exposure would be minimal. Passwords in the history got there because
<ul>
<li><I>Npasswd</I> was happy with them, hence they should be hard to guess.
<li>They are no longer in use and cannot be used again while they are in
the history database.
</ul>
<P>
The password history database location and storage method can be specified
in the configuration file. The history methods available are:
<UL>
<LI> Plain file.</LI>
<LI> DBM database (recommended and default if DBM is available).</LI>
</UL>
<I>Npasswd</I> supports the password history mechanism of Digital UNIX
(OSF/1) <i>enhanced security</i> mode, and uses it in lieu of the history database.

Enforcing a minimum length of <B>six</B> characters.</LI>
<LI>
Checking for non-printable or forbidden characters. Some applications or
libraries may not deal properly with whitespace and/or control characters
in passwords. Default is to allow non-printable and whitespace characters
except common tty control characters (e.g. control-s, control-q, control-z).</LI>
<LI>
Denying excessive adjacent repeated characters.</LI>
<LI>
Encouraging a diversity of character classes (mixed case, numbers, punctuation).</LI>
<LI>
Looking for easily guessed patterns (U.S. Social Security, telephone numbers).</LI>

<H2>Password check dictionaries</H2>
<div class=para>
<P>
<I>Crack</i>, the most popular password guessing program, makes extensive
use of word collections. Each word is permuted in various ways, encrypted
and compared to the target cyphertext. The more words that Crack has available,
the more passwords it <B>will</B> guess.
<P>
The primary function of <I>npasswd</I> is to frustrate bad guys running Crack.
To this end, some of Crack has been incorporated into <I>npasswd</i>.
<P>
<B>Dictionaries</B> are a set of hash files optimized for fast lookup.
They are
constructed from <b>word lists</b>, which are text files with one word per line.
The dictionary hash files are created with 
<A HREF="makedict_1.html">makedict</A>, which 
produces files with the suffixes <b>.pwd</b>, <b>.pwi</b> and
<b>.hwm</b>.
The hash files are probably are not portable between CPU architectures, 
and take up more disk space their source data.
<P>
The dictionary hash files normally live in the dictionary directory
(<b>@NPASSWD-DICT@</b>), but can be placed elsewhere
and pointed to in the <A HREF="Reference.html#passwd.Dictionaries">
configuration file</A>.  Multiple dictionary directories can be given.
<P>
To make a dictionary accessible to <I>npasswd</I>, copy the hash files
(or make symlinks) into the appropriate directory.
The files should be <B>world-readable</B>. <I>Npasswd</I>
will reject any dictionary with a <B>world-writable</B> hash file.</LI>
<P>
You can have numerous dictionaries, each generated from a distinct group
of words (the suggested way), or one large dictionary.
<P>
The more dictionary words available to <I>npasswd</I>, the fewer passwords
it will accept. The passwords it <B>does</B> accept will be harder (but
not impossible) to guess. The downside is that users may get more frustrated
trying to think up acceptable passwords.

<H2>Password history</H2> </A>
<div class=para>
<P>
The password history mechanism controls password reuse. If the history
mechanism is active, <I>npasswd</I> fetches the password history for a
user and compares the candidate to the active passwords in the history.
A password is <B>active</B> if it is younger than the age limit and
within the depth limit.
<P>
The age and depth limits can be set in the
<A HREF="Reference.html#passwd.History">configuration file</A>.
<P>
The history mechanism is inactive unless the database file(s) exist.
The installation process <B>does not</B> create the database.
Use the <I><A HREF="history_admin_1.html">history_admin</A></I>
utility to create and manage the database.
<P>
<H3>Security considerations</H3>
<div class=para>
<P>
By default the history database file(s) are created
read-write only by owner (typically root).  This is done to shield
the old passwords from public view, even though
<I>npasswd</I> was happy with them so they should be less susceptible to
being guessed.
<P>
For other programs to access the history database (e.g. <I>checkpassword</I>)
they may need to run as root.  It is <B>not</B> advisable to install
<B>checkpassword</B> as set-uid to root (though it will behave properly).
A suggested solution is below.
</div>
<P>

<H3> Special considerations for clusters</H3>
<div class=para>
<P>
If <I>npasswd</I> is being used on a member of a 
cluster which shares a password file, the password
history database <B>must</B> in a directory which the other
cluster members mount and can write to, preferably with root access.

<P>An alternative is to make the history database owned by
a non-root user (this works around NFS root access issues). In that
case, <I>npasswd</I> will attempt to use <I>setreuid</I>(2) to
temporarily change its effective uid to the owner of the database to update it.
<P>
Here is how to change the ownership of the history database:
<UL>
<PRE>
#
# If you are creating the history from scratch
#
@NPASSWD-HOME@/history_admin -v load < /dev/null
#
# (The confirmation message includes the history database path)
#
chown <B>new-owner</B> history-file*
#
# If you want <B>checkpassword</B> to access the history database, do
#
cd @NPASSWD-SRC@/src/PasswordCheck
make CHECKPW_MODE=4111 CHECKPW_FLAGS="-o <B>new-owner</B>" checkpassword-install
</PRE>
</UL>
</div>
<P>
<H3>Password history maintenance</H3>
<div class=para>
<P>
The history database requires periodic maintenance. Old and excess passwords,
and entries for users no longer in the password file need removing.
Periodically (weekly or monthly),
run <I><A HREF="history_admin_1.html">history_admin</A></I>
from <I>cron</I>. Make this purge a part of what is done upon deleting
users from the password file.
