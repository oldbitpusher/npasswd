<h1>With Microscope and Tweezers:</h1>
<h2>An Analysis of the Internet Virus of November 1988</h2>
<A NAME="acks"></A>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

Many people contributed to our effort to take apart the virus.  We
would like to thank them all for their help and insights both during
the immediate crisis and afterwards.
<p>

<h4>The MIT team</h4>

The MIT group effort encompassed many organizations within the
Institute.  It included people from Project Athena, the
Telecommunications Network Group, the Student Information Processing
Board (SIPB), the Laboratory for Computer Science, and the Media
Laboratory.
<p>

The SIPB's role is quite interesting.  It is a volunteer student
organization that represents students on issues of the MIT computing
environment, does software development, provides consulting to the
community, and other miscellaneous tasks.  Almost all the
members of the MIT team which took apart the virus were members of the
SIPB, and the SIPB office was the focus for early efforts at virus
catching until people gathered in the Project Athena offices.
<p>

Mark W. Eichin (Athena and SIPB) and Stanley R. Zanarotti (LCS and
SIPB) led the team disassembling the virus code. The team included
Bill Sommerfeld (Athena/Apollo Computer and SIPB), Ted Y. Ts'o (Athena
and SIPB), Jon Rochlis (Telecommunications Network Group and SIPB),
Ken Raeburn (Athena and SIPB), Hal Birkeland (Media Laboratory),
and John T. Kohl (Athena/DEC and SIPB).
<p>

Jeffrey I. Schiller (Campus Network Manager, Athena Operations
Manager, and SIPB) did a lot of work in trapping the virus, setting up
an isolated test suite, and dealing with the media.  Pascal Chesnais
(Media Laboratory) was one of the first at MIT to spot the virus.  Ron
Hoffmann (Network Group) was one of the first to notice an MIT machine
attacked by finger.
<p>

Tim Shepard (LCS) provided information about the propagation of the
virus, as well as large amounts of ``netwatch'' data and other
technical help.
<p>

James D. Bruce (EECS Professor and Vice President for Information
Systems) and the MIT News Office did an admirable job of keeping the
media manageable and letting us get our work done.
<p>

<h4>The Berkeley Team</h4>

We communicated and exchanged code with Berkeley extensively
throughout the morning of 4 November 1988. The team there included
Keith Bostic (Computer Systems Research Group, University of
California, Berkeley), Mike Karels (Computer Systems Research Group,
University of California, Berkeley), Phil Lapsley (Experimental
Computing Facility, University of California, Berkeley), Dave Pare (FX
Development, Inc.), Donn Seeley (University of Utah), Chris Torek
(University of Maryland), and Peter Yee (Experimental Computing Facility,
University of California, Berkeley).
<p>

<h4>Others</h4>
Numerous others across the country deserve thanks; many of them worked
directly or indirectly on the virus, and helped coordinate the spread
of information.  Special thanks should go to Gene Spafford (Purdue)
for serving as a central information point and providing key insight
into the workings of the virus.  Don Becker (Harris Corporation) has
provided the most readable decompilation of the virus which we have
seen to date.  It was most helpful.
<p>

An attempt was made to provide a review copy of this paper to all people
mentioned by name.  Most read a copy and many provided useful corrections.
<p>

People who offered particularly valuable advice included Judith
Provost, Jennifer Steiner, Mary Vogt, Stan Zanarotti, Jon Kamens, Marc
Horowitz, Jenifer Tidwell, James Bruce, Jerry Saltzer, Steve Dyer, Ron
Hoffmann and many unnamed people from the SIPB Office.  Any remaining
flaws in this paper are our fault, not theirs.
<p>

Special thanks to Bill Sommerfeld for providing the description of the
finger attack
and its discovery.
