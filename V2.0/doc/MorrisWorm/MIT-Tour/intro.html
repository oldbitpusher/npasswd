The Internet<a href="bibliography.html#internet">[internet]</a><a href="bibliography.html#notablenets">[notablenets]</a>, a collection of
interconnected networks linking approximately 60,000 computers, was
attacked by a virus program on 2 November 1988.  The Internet
community is comprised of academic, corporate, and 
goverment research users, all seeking to exchange information to
enhance their research efforts.
 <P>
The virus broke into Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD)
<A HREF="intro.html#footnote-unix">UNIX</A> and derivative systems.  Once
resident in a computer, it attempted to break into other machines
on the network.  This paper is an analysis of that virus program
and
of the reaction of the Internet community to the attack.

In Section <a href="intro.html#intro">[intro]</a> we discuss the categorization of
the program which attacked the Internet, the goals of the teams
working on isolating the virus and the methods they employed, and
summarize what the virus did and did not actually do.
In Section <a href="strategies.html#strat">[strat]</a> 
we discuss in more detail the strategies it employed, the specific
attacks it used, and the effective and ineffective defenses
proposed by the community.
 <P>
Section <a href="chronology.html#chron">[chron]</a> is a detailed
presentation of the chronology of the virus.  It
describes how our group at MIT found out and reacted to the crisis,
and relate the experiences and actions of select other groups
throughout the country, especially as they interacted with our group.
 <P>
Once the crisis had passed, the Internet community had time not only to explore
the
vulnerabilities which had allowed the attack to succeed, but also to
consider how future attacks could be prevented.
Section <a href="conclusion.html#lessons">[lessons]</a> presents our views on the lessons learned and problems
to be faced in the future.  
In Section <a href="ack.html#acks">[acks]</a> we acknowledge the people on
our team and the people at other sites who aided us in the effort to
understand the virus.
 <P>
We present a subroutine by subroutine description of the virus program
itself in Appendix <a href="program.html#progappendix">[progappendix]</a>, including a diagram
of the information flow through the routines which comprise the
``cracking engine''. 
Appendix <a href="dict.html#dict">[dict]</a> contains a list of the words included in the
built-in dictionary carried by the virus.
 <P>
Finally in Appendix <a href="people.html#cast">[cast]</a> we provide an alphabetized list of all
the people mentioned in this paper, their affiliations, and their
network mail addresses.

The question of how to classify the program which infected the
Internet has received a fair amount of attention.  Was it a ``virus''
or ``worm''; or was it something else?
 <P>
There is confusion about the term ``virus.''  To a biologist a virus
is an agent of infection which can only grow and reproduce within a
host cell.  A lytic virus enters a cell and uses the cell's own
metabolic machinery to replicate.  The newly created viruses (more
appropriately called ``virons'') break out of the infected cell,
destroying it, and then seek out new cells to infect.  A lysogenetic virus,
on the other hand, alters the genetic material of its host cells.  When
the host cell reproduces it unwittingly reproduces the viral genes.
At some point in the future, the viral genes are activated and many
virons are produced by the cell.  These proceed to break out of the
cell and seek out other cells to infect<a href="bibliography.html#biovirus2">[biovirus2]</a>.  Some single
strand DNA viruses do not kill the host cell;  they use the
machinery of the host cell to reproduce (perhaps slowing normal celluar
growth by diverting resources) and exit the cells in a
non-destructive manner<a href="bibliography.html#biossdna">[biossdna]</a>.  
 <P>
A ``worm'' is an organism with an elongated segmented body.  Because
of the shape of their bodies worms can
snake around obstacles and work their way into unexpected places.
Some worms, for example the tapeworm, are parasites.  They live inside
of a host organism, feeding directly from nutrients intended for host
cells.  These worms reproduce by shedding one of their segments which
contains many eggs.  They have difficulty in reaching new hosts,
since they usually leave an infected host through its excretory system
and may not readily come into contact with another host<a href="bibliography.html#bioworm">[bioworm]</a>.
 <P>
In deciding which term fits the program which infected the Internet,
we must decide which part of the system is analogous to the
``host''.  Possibilities include the network, host computers,
programs, and processes.   We must also consider the actions of the
program and its structure.
 <P>
Viewing the network layer as the ``host'' is not fruitful; the
network was not attacked, specific hosts on the network were.
The infection never spread beyond the Internet even though there were
gateways to other types of networks.   
One could view the
infection as a worm, which ``wiggled'' throughout the network.  But as
Beckman points out<a href="bibliography.html#ncsc">[ncsc]</a> the program didn't have connected
``segments'' in any sense.  Thus it can't be a worm.
 <P>
A model showing the computers as the ``host'' is more promising.  The
infection of 2 November entered the hosts, reproduced, and exited in
search of new hosts to infect.  Some people might argue that since
the host was not destroyed in this process, that the
infecting program was more like a worm than a virus.  But, as
mentioned earlier, not all viruses destroy their host cells.
Denning
<a href="bibliography.html#denning">[denning]</a> defines a computer worm as a program which enters a
workstation and disables it.  In that sense the infection could be
considered a worm, but we reject this definition.  The infected computers
were affected but not all were ``disabled''. There is also no analog to
the segments of a biological worm.
 <P>
Denning has described how many personal computer programs have been
infected by viral programs<a href="bibliography.html#denning">[denning]</a>.  These are frequently
analogous to lysogenetic viruses because they modify the actual
program code as stored in the computer's secondary storage.  As the
infected programs are copied from computer to computer through normal
software distribution, the viral code is also copied.  At some point
the viral code may activate and perform some action such as deleting
files or displaying a message.  Applying this definition of a virus while
viewing programs as ``hosts'' does not
work for the Internet infection, since the virus neither attacked nor
modified programs in any way.
 <P>
If, however, processes are view as ``hosts'', then the Internet
infection can clearly be considered a viral infection.  The virus
entered hosts through a daemon process, tricking that process into
creating a viral process, which would then attempt to reproduce.  In
only one case, the finger attack, was the daemon process actually
changed; but as we noted above only lysogenetic viruses actually
change their host's genetic material.  
 <P>
Denning defines a bacterium as a program which
replicates itself and feeds off the host's computational resources.
While this seems to describe the program which infected the Internet,
it is an awkward and vague description which doesn't seem to convey the
nature of the infection at all.
 <P>
Thus we have chosen to call the program which infected the Internet a
virus.  We feel it is accurate and descriptive.
 <P>
<A NAME="goals">
<H4>Goals and Targets</H4>


The program that attacked many Internet hosts was itself
attacked by teams of programmers around the country. The goal of these
teams was to find out <em>all</em> the inner workings of the
virus.  This included not just
understanding how to stop further attacks, but also understanding
whether any permanent damage had been done, including 
destruction or alteration of data during the actual
infection, or possible ``time bombs'' left for later execution.
 <P>
There were several steps in achieving these goals:
including
<ul>
<li> isolating a specimen of the virus in a form which could be analyzed.
<li> ``decompiling'' the virus, into a form that could be shown to
reduce to the executable of the real thing, so that the higher level
version could be interpreted.
<li> analyzing the strategies used by the virus, and the elements of
its design, in order to find weaknesses and methods of defeating it.
</ul>
 <P>
The first two steps were completed by the morning of 4 November 1988. Enough
of the third was complete to determine that the virus was harmless,
but there were no clues to the higher level issues, such as the reason
for the virus' rapid spread.
 <P>
Once the decompiled code existed, and the threat of the virus known to
be minimal, it was clear to the MIT team and those at Berkeley that
the code should be protected.  We understood that the knowledge
required to write such a program could not be kept secret, but felt
that if the code were publicly available, someone could too easily
modify it and release a damaging mutated strain.
If this occurred before many hosts had
removed the bugs which allowed the penetration in the first place,
much damage would be done.
 <P>
There was also a clear need to explain to the community what the virus
was and how it worked. This information, in the form of this report,
can actually be <em>more</em> useful to interested people than the
source code could be, since it includes discussion of the side effects
and results of the code, as well as flaws in it, rather than merely
listing the code line by line. Conversely, there are people interested
in the intricate detail of how and why certain routines were used;
there should be enough detail here to satisfy them as well.  Readers
will also find Seely<a href="bibliography.html#seely">[seely]</a> and Spafford's<a href="bibliography.html#spafpaper">[spafpaper]</a> papers
interesting.

<H4>Major Points</H4>

This section provides an outline of the how the virus attacked and
who it attacked.  It also lists several things the virus did not do,
but which many people seem to have attributed to the virus.  All of
the following points are described in more detail in Section <a href="strategies.html#strat">[strat]</a>.
 <P>
<H5>How it entered</H5>

<ul>
<li> sendmail (needed debug mode, as in SunOS binary releases)
<li> finger<a href="bibliography.html#finger">[finger]</a> (only VAX
hosts were victims)
<li> remote execution system, using
<ul>
<li> rexec
<li> rsh
</ul>
</ul>

<H5>Who it attacked</H5>

<ul>
<li> accounts with obvious passwords, such as
<ul>
<li> none at all
<li> the user name
<li> the user name appended to itself
<li> the ``nickname''
<li> the last name
<li> the last name spelled backwards
</ul>
<li> accounts with passwords in a 432 word dictionary
(see Appendix <a href="dict.html#dict">[dict]</a>)
<li> accounts with passwords in <code>/usr/dict/words</code>
<li> accounts which trusted other machines via the <code>.rhosts</code> mechanism 
</ul>

<H5>What it attacked</H5>

<ul>
<li> SUNs and VAXes only 
<li> machines in <code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code>

<li> machines in cracked accounts' <code>.rhosts</code> files
<li> machines listed as network gateways in routing tables
<li> machines at the far end of point-to-point interfaces
<li> possibly machines at randomly guessed addresses on networks of first
hop gateways
</ul>

<H5>What it did NOT do</H5>

<ul>
<li> gain privileged access (it almost never broke in as <code>root</code>)
<li> destroy or attempt to destroy any data
<li> leave time bombs behind
