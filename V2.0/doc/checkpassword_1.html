<B>NAME</B>
     checkpassword - check passwords for guessability

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     /checkpassword [ -<B>c </B>file ] [ -<B>o </B>] [ -<B>u </B>uid ] [
     -<B>XDn </B>] [ -<B>Xh </B>] [ -<B>XV </B>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Checkpassword </I>reads passwords from the  standard  input  and
     subjects  them  to suitability tests.  It purposely does <B>not</B>
     take  a  password  argument  since  process  arguments   are
     displayed by <I>ps</I>(1).

     <I>Checkpassword </I>reads passwords from the  standard  input  and
     <B>does not </B>suppress character echo.  The standard input can be
     redirected from a pipe  or  file,  which  facilitates  being
     called by a program or script.

     <I>Checkpassword </I>exits with 0 if  the  password  was  suitable.
     Otherwise  a  message  is  sent  to standard output and exit
     status is 1.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     -<B>c        </B>Take the next argument as the  configuration  file
               to  read.   <I>Checkpassword </I>uses the same configura-
               tion file as <I>npasswd</I>, ignoring directives that  do
               not  apply.   Consult  the manual page for <I>npasswd</I>
               for help with the configuration directives.

     -<B>o        </B>Test one password and exit with check status.

     -<B>u        </B>Take the next argument as the user (user  name  or
               numeric  uid)  to use for password checking.  This
               option is restricted to the super-user.

     -<B>XD</B><I>N      </I>Set internal debugging level to N.

               This option may be restricted to root.

     -<B>Xh       </B>Print help message.

     -<B>XV       </B>Print version information.

<B>BUGS</B>
     <B>Checkpassword </B>does not run with privileges, and the  <B>npasswd</B>
     history  database  is  protected  from general access.  This
     effectively disables the <I>password history </I>check.

     On Digital UNIX systems,  <B>checkpassword  </B>can  be  setgid  to
     group <I>auth </I>to access the shadow database.

     See the <I>Npasswd Administration Guide </I>for details.
