<h1 align=center>NIS and password aging</h1>
<p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<div class=para>
Solaris (and some versions of Linux) have centralized many administrative
    functions into Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAMs).
<p>
The PAM routines do the work of password verification and changing.
<p>
Example: <b>/bin/login</b> calls the <b>pam_unix</b>
module (see <b>/etc/pam.conf</b>) to handle the <b>login</b> service.
That module prompts the user for a password,
figures out from <b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b> which backend
(<b>/usr/lib/nss_XXX.so</b>) to load to find the user information.
<p>
<h4> From the Solaris 7 man page shadow(4):</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
<b>/etc/shadow</b> is an access-restricted ASCII system  file  that
stores  users'  encrypted passwords and related information.
The shadow file can be used in conjunction with other shadow
sources,   including   the   NIS   maps   passwd.byname  and
passwd.byuid and the NIS+ table <b>passwd</b>.  Programs  use  the
<i>getspnam</i>(3C) routines to access this information.
<pre>
       The fields are
  
       <b>lastchg</b>   The number of days between January 1, 1970, and
                 the date that the password was last modified.
       <b>min</b>       The minimum number of days required between password changes.
       <b>max</b>       The maximum number of days the password is valid.
       <b>warn</b>      The number of days before password expires that
                 the user is warned.
       <b>inactive</b>  The number of days of inactivity allowed for that user.
       <b>expire </b>   An absolute date specifying when login may no longer be used.
</pre>
</div>
  
<h4>How it works</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
If <tt>((current-time - lastchg) &gt; max)</tt>
the password has expired and the module performs a password change.
The calling program knows nothing of this.
The <i>passwd</i> program is <b>not</b> invoked, hence <i>npasswd</i>
cannot be inserted in the process.
<p> 
<i>Npasswd</i> does the following:
<ul> 
<li> Updates <b>lastchg</b> to mark when it changed the password.
<li> Checks <b>min</b> to enforce minimal password age.
<li> Does <b>not</b> check <b>max</b>, except to disallow changes under some conditions.
<li> Invokes the vendor <b>passwd</b> program to change aging for a password.
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p> 
<h2>NIS and password aging</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
Password aging parameters are not included in the standard passwd file format.
Though the definition for <b>struct passwd</b> has a <b>pw_age</b>
element, there is no corresponding field in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.
There can be no password aging without supplimental information.
<p>
This supplimental information is typically stored in <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>,
along with the encrytped password.
When the standard NIS maps are built, the encrypted password is taken from
shadow entries and included in the <b>passwd.byname</b> and
<b>passwd.byuid</b> maps.
The format of these maps <b>do not</b> include the aging information.
<p>
This means that password aging <b>is not available</b> on NIS clients.</font>
<p>
From Volume 1 of <i>Solaris 8 System Administration Guide</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
If you are using NIS+ or the /etc files to store user
account information, you can set up password aging on a
user's password.
</blockquote>
<p>
The only way to have password aging is to run
NIS in <b>C2</b> security mode. This gets you a NIS map named
<tt>passwd.adjunct.byname</tt> which contains the shadow password and aging information.
<p>
</div>

<h2>Changing passwords on NIS clients</h2>
<div class=para>
<P>
From the manual page for yppasswd(1m):
<p>
<blockquote>
	Entries in the <b>passwd</b>, <b>shadow</b> or
	<b>passwd.adjunct</b>  files  are  only 
	changed  if  the  password presented by <i>yppasswd</i>(1) matches the
	encrypted  password  of the  entry.
</blockquote>
<p>
From <i>/usr/include/rpcsvc/yppasswd.h</i>:
<pre>
	struct yppasswd {
		char *oldpass;          /* old (unencrypted) password */
		struct passwd newpw;    /* new pw structure */
	};
</pre>
<p>
If <i>npasswd</i> detects that it is running on a NIS client
<tt>(hostname != NIS master for passwd.byname)</tt>,
or does not find the passwd entry in any
of the files in its list (but did get it from NIS), it will use the
RPC interface to make the passwd change.
<p>
As detailed above, the RPC interface <b>requires</b>
the current password be provided
in cleartext.  The <tt>yppasswd</tt> daemon will only work if this is given (or the
target entry has a null password).
<p>
<i>Npasswd</i> makes the assumption that if root is changing someone else's password
on a NIS client, it is because the current password is unknown.  In that
case,  <b>the password CANNOT be changed via the RPC interface</b>.  The only
place to change an unknown password is the NIS master.
<p>
One could fault <i>npasswd</i> for being pendantic on this point.  
My experience as a system administrator
is that when I am changing a users' password as root, it is because the user
does not know it,  hence I must make the change on the
NIS master, then invoke the NIS map update procedure so the user can login.
<p>
The bottom line is that substantial user management (e.g. password changes)
needs to be done <b>on the NIS master</b>.
</div>
<p>
<h2>Password files on NIS masters</h2>
<div class=para>
<p>
During the process of customizing npasswd,
the <i>Configure</i> script probes the system for password files.
This list is presented and the builder is offered the option of changing it.
<P>
In the process of looking for a user entry, npasswd examines <b>every</b>
file in this list.  If the user is found and the entry is not
an NIS stub (e.g. <tt>+user::0:0:::</tt>),
then that file is marked as the source
for the entry and the password field will be changed in that file.  
<P>
Should the user not be found in any of the local files then NIS is
searched.  If the user is found in NIS, that service is marked as the
source and the password will be changed via the RPC mechanism.
<P>
When a file other than <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> is used as the NIS map source,
that file must be in included in the password file list.
<P>
For example, if your NIS map is built from <tt>/var/yp/src/passwd</tt>,
then that file must be in npasswd's internal file list.
<P>
If you attempt to change a local password on the NIS master 
and get the message "<b>Information can only be changed on NIS master</b>",
then you need to redo the password file list.
<P>
To do this, run <tt>"Configure -d"</tt> and when
prompted "<tt>Change passwd file list?</tt>" reply 'y' and enter the path to 
your NIS passwd master file.  Then rebuild and install <i>npasswd</i>.
