<div class=para>
<P>
<I>Npasswd</I> subjects password candidates to a series of guessability
tests. The password is accepted only if it passes all of them.
<P>
Which tests are used and the order of application is customizable in the
configuration file. Some tests are mandatory, and others optional (as noted
below).

<P>
The available password tests are:
<p>
<H3>History</H3>
<ul>
<P>
Password history discourages too frequent password reuse.
Password candidates are compared to the passwords in the users' history
and rejected if found. When a password change is done, the encrypted
new password is stored in the history database.
<P>
Access to the history database should be restricted.
Should the history database fall into hostile hands, the security
exposure would be minimal. Passwords in the history got there because
<I>npasswd</I> was happy with them, hence they should be hard to guess.
See <A HREF="#admin_history">below</A> for details.

<P>The password history database location and storage method can be specified
in the configuration file. The history methods available are:
<UL>
<LI> Plain file.</LI>
<LI> DBM database (recommended and default if DBM is available).</LI>
</UL>
<I>Npasswd</I> supports the password history mechanism of Digital UNIX
(OSF/1) "enhanced security" mode, and uses it in lieu of the history database.

<P>
See also:
The <A HREF="Reference.html#passwd.History">password history</A>
section of the <A HREF="Reference.html"><I>Npasswd Reference Manual</I>.</A>
</ul>
<H3> Lexical</H3>
<ul>
The lexical check includes:
<UL>
<LI>
Enforcing a minimum length of <B>six</B> characters.</LI>

<LI>
Checking for non-printable or forbidden characters. Some applications or
libraries may not deal properly with whitespace and/or control characters
in passwords. Default is to allow non-printable and whitespace characters
except common tty control characters (e.g. control-s, control-q, control-z).</LI>

<LI> Denying excessive adjacent repeated characters.</LI>

<LI>
Encouraging a diversity of character classes (mixed case, numbers, punctuation).</LI>

<LI>
Looking for easily guessed patterns (U.S. Social Security, telephone numbers).</LI>
</UL>
These criteria can be modified via the configuration file.

</ul>

<h3>Local</H3>
<ul>
This is the hook for the insertion of site-specific tests.
The standard code checks if the candidate is a variation of the system
hostname, aliases, or entries in the users' <B>.rhosts.</B>
</ul>

<H3>Passwd</H3>
<ul>
<P>
The candidate is examined to see if it is derived from the users' <I>passwd</I>
information.
</ul>

<H3> Dictionary</H3>
<ul>
<I>Npasswd</I> checks the candidate against words in various <I>dictionaries</I>.
The candidate is rejected if it can be derived from any word in the dictionaries.
A variant of the <I>Crack</I> password guessing code is used for this purpose.

<H2>More about dictionaries</H2>
<div class=para>
<P>
<I>Crack</i>, the most popular password guessing program, makes extensive
use of word collections. Each word is permuted in various ways, encrypted
and compared to the target cyphertext. The more words that Crack has available,
the more passwords it <B>will</B> guess.
<P>
The primary function of <I>npasswd</I> is to frustrate bad guys running Crack.
To this end, some of Crack has been incorporated into <I>npasswd</i>.
<P>
<B>Dictionaries</B> are a set of hash files optimized for fast lookup.
They are
constructed from <b>word lists</b>, which are text files with one word per line.
The dictionary hash files are created with 
<A HREF="makedict_1.html">makedict</A>, which 
produces files with the suffixes <b>.pwd</b>, <b>.pwi</b> and
<b>.hwm</b>.
The hash files are probably are not portable between CPU architectures, 
and take up more disk space their source data.
<P>
The dictionary hash files normally live in the dictionary directory
(<b>@NPASSWD-DICT@</b>), but can be placed elsewhere
and pointed to in the <A HREF="Reference.html#passwd.Dictionaries">
configuration file</A>.  Multiple dictionary directories can be given.
<P>
To make a dictionary accessible to <I>npasswd</I>, copy the hash files
(or make symlinks) into the appropriate directory.
The files should be <B>world-readable</B>. <I>Npasswd</I>
will reject any dictionary with a <B>world-writable</B> hash file.</LI>
<P>
You can have numerous dictionaries, each generated from a distinct group
of words (the suggested way), or one large dictionary.
<P>
The more dictionary words available to <I>npasswd</I>, the fewer passwords
it will accept. The passwords it <B>does</B> accept will be harder (but
not impossible) to guess. The downside is that users may get more frustrated
trying to think up acceptable passwords.

<A NAME="admin_history"> <H2>More about password history</H2> </A>
<div class=para>
<P>
The password history mechanism controls password reuse. If the history
mechanism is active, <I>npasswd</I> fetches the password history for a
user and compares the candidate to the active passwords in the history.
A password is <B>active</B> if it is younger than the age limit and
within the depth limit.
<P>
The age and depth limits can be set in the
<A HREF="Reference.html#passwd.History">configuration file</A>.
<P>
The history mechanism is inactive unless the database file(s) exist.
The installation process <B>does not</B> create the database.
Use the <I><A HREF="history_admin_1.html">history_admin</A></I>
utility to create and manage the database.
<P>
<H3>Security considerations</H3>
<div class=para>
<P>
By default the history database file(s) are created
read-write only by owner (typically root).  This is done to shield
the old passwords from public view, even though
<I>npasswd</I> was happy with them so they should be less susceptible to
being guessed.
<P>
For other programs to access the history database (e.g. <I>checkpassword</I>)
they may need to run as root.  It is <B>not</B> advisable to install
<B>checkpassword</B> as set-uid to root (though it will behave properly).
A suggested solution is below.
</div>
<P>

<H3> Special considerations for clusters</H3>
<P>
If <I>npasswd</I> is being used on a member of a 
cluster which shares a password file, the password
history database <B>must</B> in a directory which the other
cluster members mount and can write to, preferably with root access.

<P>An alternative is to make the history database owned by
a non-root user (this works around NFS root access issues). In that
case, <I>npasswd</I> will attempt to use <I>setreuid</I>(2) to
temporarily change its effective uid to the owner of the database to update it.
<P>
Here is how to change the ownership of the history database:
<UL>
<PRE>
#
# If you are creating the history from scratch
#
@NPASSWD-HOME@/history_admin -v load < /dev/null
#
# (The confirmation message includes the history database path)
#
chown <B>new-owner</B> history-file*
#
# If you want <B>checkpassword</B> to access the history database, do
#
cd @NPASSWD-SRC@/src/PasswordCheck
make CHECKPW_MODE=4111 CHECKPW_FLAGS="-o <B>new-owner</B>" checkpassword-install
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Password history maintenance</H3>
<P>
The history database requires periodic maintenance. Old and excess passwords,
and entries for users no longer in the password file need removing.
Periodically (weekly or monthly),
run <I><A HREF="history_admin_1.html">history_admin</A></I>
from <I>cron</I>. Make this purge a part of what is done upon deleting
users from the password file.
<P>
