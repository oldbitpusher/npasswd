     _C_h_e_c_k_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d reads passwords from the  standard  input  and
     subjects  them  to suitability tests.  It purposely does nnnnooootttt
     take  a  password  argument  since  process  arguments   are
     displayed by _p_s(1).

     _C_h_e_c_k_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d reads passwords from the  standard  input  and
     ddddooooeeeessss nnnnooootttt suppress character echo.  The standard input can be
     redirected from a pipe  or  file,  which  facilitates  being
     called by a program or script.

     _C_h_e_c_k_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d exits with 0 if  the  password  was  suitable.
     Otherwise  a  message  is  sent  to standard output and exit
     status is 1.

     -cccc        Take the next argument as the  configuration  file
               to  read.   _C_h_e_c_k_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d uses the same configura-
               tion file as _n_p_a_s_s_w_d, ignoring directives that  do
               not  apply.   Consult  the manual page for _n_p_a_s_s_w_d

     -oooo        Test one password and exit with check status.

     -uuuu        Take the next argument as the user (user  name  or
               numeric  uid)  to use for password checking.  This
               option is restricted to the super-user.
