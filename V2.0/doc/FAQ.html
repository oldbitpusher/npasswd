<a name="_shadow"></a>
<h4>My system has shadow passwords. Why would I want <i>npasswd</i>?</h4>
<div class=para>
Shadow passwords makes it <b>harder</b> for a bad guy
to obtain encrypted passwords. But that protection is a function of
the UNIX file system, and there are a number of "root kits" available
for intruders to gain super-user privileges on your system so
they can get a copy of your password and shadow files. Those cracked accounts
then may become jumping off points for more attacks or used as a source 
for spammers.
<p>
Combining intelligent password checking with a shadow database provides
the best protection short of one-time use passwords or challenge/response
smart card systems.
</div>
<p>
<h4>Is npasswd compatible with the passwd program supplied by my
system vendor?</h4>
<div class=para>
The basic functionality of the passwd program (changing passwords)
is the same. However, many vendor passwd programs
have specialty options that npasswd does not. This is usually because the
option is ill-documented or very esoteric and a hard
to replicate. The <i>npasswd</i> installation procedure will
preserve the vendor programs in the npasswd installation directory.
These programs will be invoked to do what <i>npasswd</i> cannot.
</div>
<h4>Are there npasswd binaries that I can drop in?</h4>
<div class=para>
<i>Npasswd</i> is distributed in
source for the following reasons: </div>
<ul>
<li>There are customizations which must be chosen at
compilation time.
I consider these options important for you the system administrator
to be aware of even though you may safely accept the defaults.</li>
<li>I did not want to arbitrarily decide where you might
want to install <i>npasswd</i>.
For example, location of the password
history database may be dependent upon system configuration. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>How much do I need to know to build and install npasswd?</h4>
<div class=para>A lot of work has gone into
making npasswd easier to build,
install and maintain. However, this is not a "turn the crank and go"
process.
You should be familiar with your C compiler and <i>make</i>.
</div>
<h4>What support is available?</h4>
<div class=para>Bug reports will be investigated
on a time-available basis.
See the <a href="Support.html"><b>Npasswd Support Guide</b></a>.
</div>
<h4>Is any maintenance required?</h4>
<div class=para>
The password history database
may require periodic cleaning of expired passwords and removed users.
Use the <i>history_admin</i> program for this purpose.
See <a href="history_admin_1.html"><i>history_admin</i>(1)</a></div>
<p>
<h4>I am already using 'Crack' to check passwords and have a collection
of dictionaries. I use those dictionaries with npasswd?</h4>
<div class=para>
The dictionary hash format used
by Crack is optimized to conserve disk space.<br>
The <i>npasswd</i> dictionary hash format is optimized for lookup speed.<br>
Dictionaries can be converted for use by <i>npasswd</i>. See
the <a href="AdminGuide.html"><b>Npasswd Administration Guide</b></a>
for the conversion procedure.
</div>
<h4>
How many dictionaries do I need or want?
</h4>
<div class=para>
As many as you can stand. You can have multiple
dictionaries, each generated from a distinct word list or one
combined dictionary. The former approach allows easier
customization.
</div>
<h4>
What does the 'already in use' message mean?
</h4>
<div class=para>
This is a warning mesage  usually caused because the default dictionary list is
also explicitly listed in the configuration file. Dictionaries can either
be specified by the path to a file (e.g <tt>@NPASSWD-DICT@/local/my-words</tt>)
or by a path to a directory of dictionary files (e.g. <tt>@NPASSWD-DICT@/local</tt>).
<p>
<I>Npasswd</i> does an implicit "<tt>Dictionary @NPASSWD-DICT@</tt>"
directive to
pick upt the standard dictionary set.  The dictionaries in that directory should
not be listed in the configuration file, and the entries seen in the example 
configuration file are just that - examples not to be used for production.
<p>
This message can be safely ignored.
</div>
<p>
<h4> How does the size of my dictionaries affect password security? </h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
More dictionary words equals greater password security.
It may also mean greater frustration in your user community because
<i>npasswd</i> will reject more passwords.
</div>
<p>
<h4> Why are there words in the dictionary which are shorter
than the minimum password length? Wouldn't it save disk space to remove these
short words from the dictionaries?</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
Multiple permutations are made on each
dictionary word.
For example, "quick" is too short to be a password, (minimum length is 6),
but "quickly" is long enough and would be found
by the test of the plural form of the word "quick" from the dictionary.
<P>
The standard used by <i>npasswd</i> is: If this password's ciphertext ended up 
in the hands of a bad guy equipped with <i>Crack</I>, could it be guessed?  If the
answer is yes the password will be rejected as insufficently insecure.
<P>
</div>
<h4>Why is npasswd so picky about accepting passwords? </h4>
<div class=para>
Because the bad guys who are trying to get your
passwords are using powerful tools like <i>Crack</i>. The dictionary check code in
<i>npasswd</i> was written by the author of Crack, and performs the same
checks. Given sufficient dictionaries, if <i>npasswd</i> accepts a
password there is a good chance that Crack will not guess it.
</div>
<h4>What kind of passwords will npasswd accept? </h4>
<div class=para>
<ul>
  <li>A mixture of upper and lower case alphas,
with a sprinkling of punctuation
characters and digits will usually pass muster.</li>
  <li>Control and
whitespace characters can also be included, but should be used with
caution
- some applications which read passwords may not deal with these
correctly. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="_aging"></a>
<h4>Does npasswd support password aging?</h4>
<div class=para>
Refer to <A href="Password.html#_aging">password aging</a> section of
the <a href="Password.html">Password management Guide</a>.
</div>
<h4> Does npasswd support NIS?</h4>
<div class=para>
See the NIS explanation in <a href="Passwords.html#_NIS">Password guide</a>.
Summary of NIS support in npasswd:<br>
<ul>
  <li>If running on NIS master will update local files and NIS maps.</li>
  <li>If running on NIS client will use the RPC interface for updates.  </li>
  <li>Can not support password aging unless NIS is running in 'secure'
or 'C2' mode.</li>
  <li>Can detect if user is in local passwd file on NIS client and can
change that entry instead of using the RPC interface.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>
My NIS master passwd file isn't /etc/passwd.  What do I do?</h4>
<div class=para>
<i>Npasswd</i> has the capability to search multiple local passwd files, but
for security reasons their paths are hard-wired into the executable.
The primary way do this is in reply to the
<tt><b>"Change passwd file list?"</tt></b>
question displayed while running Configure.  Alternately, edit the files
<tt>"src/Methods/passwdtab.h"</tt> and <tt>"src/Methods/shadowtab.h"</tt>
and add entries pointing to your NIS master files.
<B>Warning:</b> these files will be ovewritten the next time <tt>Configure</tt>
is run.
<p>
The <i>npasswd</i> binary must be rebuilt for the new file paths
to take effect.
<p>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="_NISplus"></a>
<h4>
I believed Sun when they said NIS+ was the greatest thing ever.
Does npasswd support NIS+?</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
<i>Npasswd</i> does not have NIS+ support due to lack of
documentation from Sun for the low-level APIs.  NIS+ is based
upon Sun Secure RPC and relies heavily upon management of cipher keys.
When a user logs in their password is also used to decrypt their
personal key pair which then is used for NIS+ operations.
When the password is changed it is necessary to reencrypt
the personal key pair using the new login password.
<p>
As of Solaris 2.5 the low-level routines required to reencrypt the personal
key pair were removed from the public libraries.  Sun did provide
a new service daemon, <i>rpc.nispasswd</i> for passwd changes from
NIS+ clients but did not document the protocol.
<p>
Despite repeated inquiries and support calls, Sun refused to provide any
documentation for these APIs.  Other techniques for updating NIS+ personal
keys were considered and rejected, so all support for NIS+ was deprecated.
</div>

<h4>
Will npasswd support user indentification services like
LDAP and Kerberos?
</h4>
<div class=para>
<p>
It requires considerable effort to support each 'name service'.  In some
cases (e.g. NIS+) it cannot be done without access to vendor source code or reverse
engineering from vendor binaries. Either approach leads to intellectual
property rights issues.
<p>
The author of <i>npasswd</i> is willing to work with developers who
wish to add support for new name services.
</div>

<li>Support for shadow passwords is included but was only lightly tested.
<li>AIX 4.1 has many password restrictions which can be set per-user or
system wide.  These include lexical requirements, dictionary searches
(though not nearly as vigorous that done by <I>npasswd</I>) and a
hook for external password check modules.  Judicious use  of
these restrictions should result in passwords which are harder to crack.
<li>
You may desire to tune these password restrictions first <B>before</B>
converting to <I>npasswd</I>.
<li>The words lists from this distribution could be used as password check 
dictionaries.
