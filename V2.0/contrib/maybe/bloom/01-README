Make options:
------------

(Edit "Makefile" to change them.)

DEBUG controls location of the filter (local or /usr/adm) and a small
amount of print during checks.

VOWEL_STRIP controls whether the program rejects passwords which can be
derived from dictionary words by deleting vowels (mysterious --> mystrs).
Strictly speaking, the program won't block all Crack-guessable
passwords unless this option is set, but these are relatively unlikely
passwords and this option adds substantially to the size of the filter
derived from a given word list.

LONG_REVERSE controls whether the program rejects passwords which can
be derived from dictionary words by reversing and truncating to 8
characters (mysterious --> suoirets).  Note that even with the option
unset the program would reject "suoiretsym" and "oiretsym".  Strictly
speaking, the program won't block all Crack-guessable passwords unless
this option is set, but these are relatively unlikely passwords and
this option adds substantially to the size of the filter derived from a
given word list.

The Makefile as it stands has DEBUG set and VOWEL_STRIP and
LONG_REVERSE unset.  Note that for the latter two options to take
effect the filter-maker must have been compiled with those options
set.  The filter in "checkpasswd.filter" was made with those options
unset.
