This directory contains an experimental version of checkpasswd which
uses a Bloom filter to check words against a dictionary, and which
rejects words which Crack, using the same dictionary, would guess.

The file "checkpasswd.filter" is a one-megabyte filter made from a
large word list (~500,000 items).

This version comprises only the standalone "checkpasswd" and the
program which constructs filters from word lists.   To compile, type
"make".  To run, type "checkpasswd".

There are fragmentary beginnings of documentation in the README files.
