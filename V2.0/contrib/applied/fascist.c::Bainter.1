Good Morning,

  Last night I finally sat down with it. I found the line crashing, I
  backtracked to find where pwp was not being properly set.

  Oddly enough I ended up right back at this spot in the code. You were
  so damn close. You just didn't do it "optimally".

  The only change that needs to be made is the addition of ! infront of
  the strncmp. (Although I am not sure if using STRINGSIZE is right or
  if strlen should be used on path.)

  Ie line 466 should be:

    if (pwp && !strncmp(lastpath, path, STRINGSIZE))

  What was happening was the pwp was being closed after reading it, but
  it was never getting reopened since pwp was not nulled out. Your solution
  simply nullified it everytime and then reopened it. I honestly didn't
  look to see if it can somehow happen such that pwp exists and is not
  the previous dictionary file.

  Btw, I *should* be in this weekend working on npasswd some more. I'm
  gonna work on things such as Configure doing the "right" thing with
  debug options, p_keepdir, the Makefiles not being dependant on Jmakefile
  if jmake doesn't exist, installation paths for binaries, installing
  checkpasswd, makedict fix, etc.

Ciao,
