Subject: Patching my patch
Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 420


Two more changes, one to the original code, and
one to fix an error I introduced.

1) In passwd.c, function get_password, line 6:
old: int   ntries=0;
newL int   ntries=1;

2) In PasswordCheck/pwck_main.c, function
clear_dict:

Add a line right before the function closing brace
as follows:
Config.dictionaries=0;     /*Force a realloc*/

Hope the new year is a good one for you.
