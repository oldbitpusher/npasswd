Hello,

npasswd is working very well now. There is just a small problem:
passwd.MaxRepeat is not recognized by npasswd. I commented it out
from passwd.conf.

The original post is appended to this mail.

I got 3 replies from:

Martin J. Evans (MartinE@easysoft.com)
Clyde Hoover <clyde@motown.cc.utexas.edu>
MIKE STUTE <mstute@compucom.com> 

Thanks to them.

Following is the solution.

1) If npasswd prints incorrect error messages:

edit src/PasswordCheck/pwck_lexical.c
   I did it as advised by MIKE STUTE:

May be just changing '#define P_MAX   P_S' to '#define P_MAX   P_S+1' 
could solve the problem ? This is what Clyde Hoover asked me to do.

2) Making the dictionnaries
I solved the makedict script problem by changing 
tr $trup $trlow
to
tr '[A-Z]'  '[a-z]'
in the src/PasswordCheck/cracklib/tools/makedict before running make install.
This works but I am not sure it is the best solution
