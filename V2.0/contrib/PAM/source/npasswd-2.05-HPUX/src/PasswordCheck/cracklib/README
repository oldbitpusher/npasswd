README for npasswd distribution of CrackLib.

CrackLib is an offshoot of the the version 5 "Crack" software, and
contains a considerable number of ideas nicked from the new software.

The original Cracklib documentation is in the directory CREDITS.

Modifications have been made to the Cracklib source to integrate it
into npasswd/checkpassword.

Cracklib was written by Alec Muffett (alecm@crypto.dircon.co.uk), and
modified for use in npasswd by Clyde Hoover (c.hoover@cc.utexas.edu).

There is scant documentation about Cracklib other than the source.  But 
if you are getting into this sort of business, then reading C programs
should be pretty straightforward.
