User Commands                                          npasswd(1)



<B>NAME</B>
     npasswd - change login password, shell or finger information

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>npasswd </B>[ <I>platform options </I>] [ -<B>X </B><I>options </I>] [ username ]
     <B>chfn </B>[ <I>platform options </I>] [ -<B>X </B><I>options </I>] [ username ]
     <B>chsh </B>[ <I>platform options </I>] [ -<B>X </B><I>options </I>] [ username ]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Npasswd </B>changes the login password, login  shell  or  finger
     information  for  a  user.   It is designed to supplement or
     replace the standard password change programs  <B>passwd</B>,  <B>chfn</B>
     and <B>chsh</B>.

     <B>Npasswd </B>addresses some common deficiencies of standard pass-
     word change programs.  It supports local passwd (and shadow)
     files, NIS maps, and enhanced security shadow databases  for
     HP-UX and Digital Unix (aka OSF/1).

     New passwords are subjected to a series of stringent guessa-
     bility  checks  to  decrease  the  chance  of users choosing
     vulnerable passwords.

     When called as "<B>chfn</B>", <B>npasswd </B>changes the  finger  informa-
     tion  associated  with  your user name or the specified user
     name.

     When called as "<B>chsh</B>", <B>npasswd </B>changes the  login  shell  of
     your user name or the specified user name.

     Only the super-user can change the password, finger informa-
     tion or shell of another user.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     Every version of <B>passwd </B>supports a different set of  command
     line  options.  <B>Npasswd </B>supports a subset of these for a few
     platforms.  It  attempts  to  recognize  the  other  vendor-
     specific options and defer to the vendor-supplied program to
     handle them.  This list may be incomplete.

<B>PLATFORM OPTIONS - SunOS 4</B>
     The following options are implemented:
           <B>-d -e -n -x</B>

     The following options are deferred to the vendor programs:
           <B>-a</B>

     The following options are ignored:
           <B>-F -l -y</B>

<B>PLATFORM OPTIONS - Solaris 2</B>

User Commands                                          npasswd(1)



               pwcheck
                    Trace password checking.

               detail
                    More detailed tracing.

               all  Turn on all debugging.

     -<B>XF       </B>Suppress new password checking.   This  option  is
               restricted  to  root and should be used very spar-
               ingly.

     -<B>Xf       </B>Change finger information.

     -<B>XI       </B>Allow standard input to be a file or  pipe.   This
               option can be used thusly:
               (echo old-password
                echo new-password
                echo new-password) | npasswd -XI ...

               This option is restricted to root.

     -<B>Xs       </B>Change login shell.

     -<B>XV       </B>Print version and patch level information.

<B>FILES</B>
     /usr/lib/passwd/npasswd - The executable
     /usr/lib/passwd/passwd.conf - Configuration file
     /usr/lib/passwd/dictionaries - Default dictionary collection
     /usr/lib/passwd/history - Default password history database

<B>SEE ALSO</B>
     /usr/lib/passwd/bin/history_admin - password history  administra-
     tion utility
     /usr/lib/passwd/doc/index.html - Npasswd Reference  Manual  (HTML
     format)

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     Many and hopefully fairly self-explanatory.

<B>BUGS</B>
     A substantial section of the password  check  code  is  very
     specific to English.

     No attempt has been made to internationalize the program.

     Some platforms (e.g. Sun, Digital Unix) have elaborate secu-
     rity  facilities.   Few of these are used by <B>npasswd</B>, mostly
     because the APIs are not documented.

     For historical reasons, there is support  for  two  obsolete
     operating  systems  -  SunOS 4 and Ultrix 4.  This code will
     removed from any future revisions.
