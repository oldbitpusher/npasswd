<B>NAME</B>
     makedict - build npasswd dictionaries

     unpacker - unpack hashed dictionary files

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     /<B>makedict </B>-<B>o </B><I>output </I>[ -<B>m </B><I>source </I>] [ -<B>T </B><I>temp  </I>]

     /<B>unpacker </B>dictionary-name

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Makedict </B>builds the hashed  dictionaries  used  by  <B>npasswd</B>.
     The  dictionary  hash files are built from <I>word lists</I>, which
     are text files with one word per line.

     Three hashed files are created with the suffixes <B>.hwm</B>, <B>.pwd</B>,
     and <B>.pwi </B>.

     <B>Packer </B>is a low-level utility which  reads  words  (one  per
     line)  from  standard  input and packs them into hash files.
     <B>Makedict </B>is a smart front-end to <B>packer</B>,  and  is  the  pre-
     ferred tool for dictionary building.

     <B>Unpacker </B>dumps dictionary hashes  to  standard  output,  one
     word per line.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     Options for <B>makedict</B>.

     -<B>o </B><I>output</I>
          Create the dictionary <B>output</B>.

     -<B>m </B><I>source</I>
          Merge in words in dictionary <B>source</B>.

     -<B>T </B><I>temp</I>
          Use <B>temp </B>as the temporary directory for  sorting.   Use
          this  option if the default temporary directory used by
          <I>sort</I>(1) is small.

     <I>words </I>... <I>words</I>
          Word lists. Compressed files (ending with  <B>.Z  </B>or  <B>.gz</B>)
          can be used.

     <B>Packer </B>and <B>unpacker </B>take one argument - the name of the dic-
     tionary file to pack or unpack.

<B>EXAMPLES</B>
     To make the dictionary 'my-dict':
          makedict -o my-dict word-list-1 ... word-list-n

User Commands                                         makedict(1)



          Will produce the  files  <B>my-dict.pwd</B>,  <B>my-dict.pwi  </B>and
          <B>my-dict.hwm</B>.

     To add words to an existing dictionary:
          makedict -o existing-dict -m existing-dict word-list-1 ... word-list-n

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     Missing option to -o
          No output file was specified.

     Missing option to -T
          No temporary directory was specified.

     Missing option to -m
          No merge dictionary was specified.

     Empty or missing hash file <I>name</I>
          One of the dictionary hash files came up empty,  either
          because  the  sources  were  empty or a filesytem error
          occurred.

<B>BUGS</B>
     The input to <B>packer must be sorted</B>,  else  the  result  hash
     files will be faulty.  Use <B>makedict </B>instead.
