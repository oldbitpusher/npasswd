	* Added copyright messages to more modules.
	* A bit of code format cleanup.

	  file is present.  This means that nsswitch.conf will ONLY be

	  different API for support.

	* Properly punt the '-r' option on SunOS 5.

		* Allow '-m' with default database
		* Fix some more annoying bugs
	* Modifications to the password history test suite to use
	  and verify the above changes
