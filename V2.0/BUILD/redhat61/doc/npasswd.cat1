       NNppaasssswwdd changes the login password, login shell or  finger
       information  for  a user.  It is designed to supplement or
       replace the standard password change programs ppaasssswwdd, cchhffnn
       and cchhsshh.

       NNppaasssswwdd  addresses  some  common  deficiencies of standard
       password change programs.  It supports local  passwd  (and
       shadow)  files,  NIS  maps,  and  enhanced security shadow
       databases for HP-UX and Digital Unix (aka OSF/1).

       New passwords are  subjected  to  a  series  of  stringent
       guessability checks to decrease the chance of users choos-
       ing vulnerable passwords.

       When called as "cchhffnn", nnppaasssswwdd changes the finger informa-
       tion  associated with your user name or the specified user
       name.

       When called as "cchhsshh", nnppaasssswwdd changes the login shell  of
       your user name or the specified user name.

       Only the super-user can change the password, finger infor-
       mation or shell of another user.

       Every version of ppaasssswwdd supports a different set  of  com-
       mand line options.  NNppaasssswwdd supports a subset of these for
       a few platforms.  It attempts to recognize the other  ven-
       dor-specific options and defer to the vendor-supplied pro-
       gram to handle them.  This list may be incomplete.

       A  substantial  section of the password check code is very
       specific to English.

       No attempt has been made to internationalize the  program.

       Some  platforms  (e.g.  Sun,  Digital Unix) have elaborate
       security facilities.  Few of these are  used  by  nnppaasssswwdd,
       mostly because the APIs are not documented.

       For  historical reasons, there is support for two obsolete
       operating systems - SunOS 4 and Ultrix 4.  This code  will
       removed from any future revisions.
