<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Npasswd version 1.0</H1>

<H1>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This is the version of <I>npasswd</I> that we used on our public UNIX
systems between 1989 and 1993. </P>

<P>This version was left behind when we
upgraded to newer hardware (Alphas) and operating systems (Solaris 2).
The port to these architectures and operating systems is
<A HREF="http://../v2.0">npasswd 2.0</A>.

<H2>Features</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Changes local and YP passwords. </LI>

<LI>Can indirectly update SunOS 4 adjunct passwords.</LI>

<LI>Can be compiled to modify alternate password files.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Limitations</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Will not compile with an ANSI&nbsp;C compiler.</LI>

<LI>Does not support shadow passwords.</LI>

<LI>Will probably not run on 64-bit CPUs (e.g. Alphas).</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Availabilty</H2>

<P>Here is the <A HREF="npasswd-1.2.4.tar.Z">compressed tar file for npasswd
1.2.4</A>.</P>

<P>This version is frozen - no more work will be done,
and questions will be answered only on a time-available basis. 
As soon as 2.0 goes into release, 1.2.4 will be removed.

<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

<P><B>1. &quot;My password file is not /etc/passwd. How do I get npasswd
to use it?&quot; </B></P>

<UL>
<P>There is a table in the module <TT>pw_yp.c</TT> which provides a choice
of locations for the password file. The first password file found is the
one used. </P>

<PRE>/*
 * List of possible locations for the password file
 */
static struct passwdinfo pwfiles[] = {
        . . .
{
        PASSWD_FILE, PASSWD_TEMP, PASSWD_SAVE,
},
{
        &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, &quot;/etc/ptmp&quot;, &quot;/etc/opasswd&quot;,
},
        . . .
</PRE>

<P>The macros <B>PASSWD_FILE</B>, <B>PASSWD_TEMP</B>and <B>PASSWD_SAVE</B>
are given default values which can be set either by modifying the source
or by changing and uncommenting the following lines in the Makefile, then
remove <TT>pw_yp.o</TT> and rebuild. </P>

<PRE>#       The password file location
# PWF = /etc/passwd
#       The temp and lock file for passwd file changes
# PWT = /etc/ptmp
#       The saved password file
# PWS = /etc/opasswd

# PWFD = -DPASSWD_FILE=\&quot;$(PWF)\&quot;
# PWTD = -DPASSWD_TEMP=\&quot;$(PWT)\&quot;
# PWSD = -DPASSWD_SAVE=\&quot;$(PWS)\&quot;</PRE>

<P>The most common circumstances where this is wanted is on an NIS master,
where the password file from which the NIS databases is built is not /etc/passwd.
For this feature to work properly, the NIS master file must ONLY exist
on the NIS master system, not the NIS clients. </P>
</UL>

<P><B>2. Does npasswd run on Solaris 2.X (or DEC OSF/1)? </B></P>

<UL>
<P>No - version 1.2 will not work on Solaris 2, DEC OSF/1 or any system
that uses System 5 style shadow password files. (There are other problems
with OSF/1, System 5 Release 4 and POSIX environments). </P>
</UL>

<P><B>3. Has it been/will it be ported to those systems? </B></P>

<UL>
<P>The port is called <A HREF="http://../v2.0">npasswd 2.0.</A> </P>
</UL>
