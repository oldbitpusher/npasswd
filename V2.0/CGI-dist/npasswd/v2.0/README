README for npasswd 2.0 beta 4 download

The distribution archives are compressed tar files.

The manual is a set of HTML documents in the doc directory.

I really need the folks who tinker with npasswd to be fairly experienced
system administrator types.

Though I have gone to a lot of trouble to make the configuration and build
procedure easy, this is a "some assembly required" package. 

I will answer all reasonable questions, but queries about programming
tasks (using make, or C programming) will be answered slowly.

Read all of the documentation in the distribution before trying to configure
and build npasswd.
