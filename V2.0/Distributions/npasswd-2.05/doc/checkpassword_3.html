<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The password check  library  is  designed  for  applications
     which  changes  passwords.  This password check engine is at
     the core of <I>npasswd</I>.

     The <B>checkpassword() </B>routine determines whether a password is
     suitable  for  use.  The <I>password </I>argument is the plain-text
     candidate password, <I>user </I>is a pointer to a passwd  structure
     from <I>getpwent</I>(3), <I>getpwnam</I>(3), or <I>getpwuid</I>(3).  This routine
     returns an  explanatory  message  if  the  password  is  not
     acceptable, and NULL otherwise.

     The  <B>checkpassword_configure()  </B>routine  sets  the  password
     check parameters.  The argument <I>command </I>is a string contain-
     ing a configuration directive.  If the <I>flagerror </I>argument is
     non-zero, unrecognized directives will be considered errors.

     This routine returns NULL  if  <I>command  </I>was  recognized  and
     accepted, and an error message otherwise.

     The configuration directives  are  a  subset  of  those  for
     <B>npasswd</B>.

     The <B>init_checkpassword() </B>routine performs initialization for
     the  password  check  routines.  It is implicitly run on the
     first  invocation  of  <B>checkpassword()</B>.   Each  call  resets
     resets the password check parameters to defaults.

     The <B>checkpassword_verify() </B>routine sanity checks the  confi-
     guration  of the password check routines. It returns NULL if
     the configuration is correct,  or  else  an  error  message.
     This  routine  should  be  called  after  the  last  use  of
     <B>init_checkpassword() </B>or <B>checkpassword_configure()</B>.

     The <B>password_history_update()  </B>routine  inserts  a  password
     into  the  history  database.  The <I>user </I>argument is the user
     name, <I>crypt</I>-<I>pass </I>is the encrypted  password  to  enter,  and
     <I>epoch  </I>is  the  time  stamp to put on the password.  If this
     argument is 0, the current time is used.

     The use of this routine requires that the  history  database
     exists  and  the  user  has privileges to write to it.  This
     usually means an effective uid of root.

     This routine returns 0 if there is no  history  database,  1
     upon success, and -1 for failure.

     If  Digital  UNIX  enhanced   security   mode   is   active,
     <B>password_history_update() </B>is a no-op.

     See manual page  for  <I>history</I>_<I>admin</I>(1)  about  managing  the
     password history database.

<B>INTERNALS</B>
     <B>Checkpassword </B>subjects password candidates to  a  series  of
     guessability  tests.  The  password  is  accepted only if it
     passes all of them.

     The tests which are used and the order of their  application
     can  be  customized  by  configuration directives.  Some the
     following tests are mandatory, others optional:

     History (optional)
          Password  history  discourages  too  frequent  password
          reuse.   Password  candidates are compared to the pass-
          words in the history record for the user  and  rejected
          if found.

          The password  history  database  location  and  storage
          method can be specified in the configuration file.

     If Digital UNIX (OSF/1) enhanced security  mode  is  active,
     that history mechanism will be used.

     Lexical (mandatory)
          These tests include:

          <B>o    </B>Enforcing a minimum length of six characters.

          <B>o    </B>Checking for non-printable  or  forbidden  charac-
               ters.  Default  is to allow non-printable and whi-
               tespace characters except common tty control char-
               acters.

          <B>o    </B>Denying excessive adjacent repeated characters.

          <B>o    </B>Encouraging  a  diversity  of  character   classes
               (mixed case, numbers, punctuation).

          <B>o    </B>Looking for easily guessed patterns  (U.S.  Social
               Security, telephone numbers).

          <B>o    </B>Passwords that do not have upper  and  lower  case
               alphabetics  may  be  rejected,  depending  on the
               check parameters.

     Local (optional)
          The password is checked  against  various  information.
          host name.

     Passwd (mandatory)
          The password is compared to a number of permutations of
          the information in the <I>user </I>argument.

     Dictionary (mandatory)
          The password is subjected to a series of tests from the
          <I>Crack  </I>password  guessing  program.  The  candidate  is
          rejected if it can be derived  from  any  word  in  the
          <B>npasswd </B>password check dictionaries.

     The password check library has extensive  internal  tracing.
     The following routines configure that facility.

     The <B>set_debug_tag() </B>routine sets the trace message  identif-
     ier.

     The <B>init_debug() </B>routine sets the  trace  level.   Refer  to
     <I>checkpassword</I>.<I>h </I>for trace level defines.

<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
     The configuration directives are:

     <B>AlphaOnly </B><I>yes </I>| <I>no</I>
          Allow alpha-only passwords.  The default is to <B>disallow</B>
          alpha-only passwords.

C Library Functions                              checkpassword(3)



     <B>CharClasses </B><I>N</I>
          Require at least <I>N </I>character classes in passwords.  The
          character classes are:

          <B>o    </B>Upper case alpha.

          <B>o    </B>Lower case alpha.

          <B>o    </B>Digits.

          <B>o    </B>Whitespace.

          <B>o    </B>Punctuation.

          <B>o    </B>Control characters.
     The higher the class requirement, the more  diverse  mixture
     of characters required.

     <B>Debug </B><I>N</I>
          Sets internal debug level to <I>N</I>, which must be  a  digit
          [0-9].  Refer to the sources for debug levels.

     <B>Dictionaries </B><I>path </I>... <I>path</I>
          Adds directories to the dictionary search  list.   Each
          directory  in the path is scanned for hashed dictionary
          files.  Multiple directories can be  specified  in  one
          directive,  and  multiple directives can be given.  The
          hash files are built with <B>makedict</B>(<I>1</I>).

     <B>DisallowedChars </B>[+]<I>string</I>
          Sets the list of characters (usually non-printable) not
          allowed.   C  backslash sequences (e.g. \b or \007) may
          be used.  <I>String </I>may be enclosed in double quotes.   If
          the  initial  character  of <I>string </I>is a plus-sign, then
          the it is <B>appended </B>to the forbidden character list.

          The default disallowed character list contains  typical
          UNIX terminal special characters.

     <B>History </B><I>args</I>
          Configure the password history mechanism.

          <B>age </B><I>N</I>
               When a  password  history  record  is  fetched  or
               updated,  any passwords older than <I>N </I>days are dis-
               carded.  The  depth  limit  (see  below)  is  also
               enforced. The default age is 180 days.

          <B>depth </B><I>N</I>
               When a  password  history  record  is  fetched  or
               updated,  all  but the <I>N </I>most recent <B>old </B>passwords
               are discarded.  The age limit (see above) is  also

               enforced.   The  default  is  to retain the last 2
               passwords.

          <B>dbm </B><I>path</I>
               Use <I>path </I>as the history database in DBM format. If
               <I>path  </I>is specified as <B>@</B>, then the default database
               is used.

          <B>file </B><I>path</I>
               Use <I>path </I>as the history database  in  "flat  file"
               format.   If  <I>path  </I>is specified as <B>@</B>, the default
               database is used.

          <B>none </B>Disable password history.

          The preferred history database method is  DBM,  and  is
          the default if the NDBM library is available.

          The @ syntax is useful to override the  default  method
          but use the default database.

          The default history database is <B>@NPASSWD-HIST@</B>.

     <B>LengthWarn </B><I>yes </I>| <I>no</I>
          Warn if the  password  is  longer  than  the  effective
          length.  This does not affect the security of the pass-
          word, but such  a  warning  may  be  desirable  from  a
          human-interface  perspective.   The  default  is to not
          issue a warning.

     <B>MaxPassword </B><I>N</I>
          Sets the maximum effective password length to <I>N </I>charac-
          ters.   The  default is platform dependent, but is usu-
          ally 8.

     <B>MaxRepeat </B><I>N</I>
          Set allowed adjacent repeated  character  count  to  <I>N</I>.
          The default is 3.

     <B>MinPassword </B><I>N</I>
          Sets the minimum acceptable length for a password to  <I>N</I>
          characters.   The  default  minimum length is 6 charac-
          ters.

     <B>PasswordChecks </B><I>proc proc </I>... <I>proc</I>
          Selects the order of  the  password  checks.   Use  the
          check  names  listed above.  The default check order is
          <B>lexical passwd local history dictionary.</B>

     <B>PrintableOnly </B><I>yes </I>| <I>no</I>
          Limit passwords to having  only  printable  characters.
          The  <I>isprint</I>(3) routine is used to determine this.  The

          default is to allow all non-printable characters except
          the  disallowed  characters.  Use of control characters
          may cause problems on some systems.

     <B>SingleCase </B><I>yes </I>| <I>no</I>
          Allow single-case (all lower case or  all  upper  case)
          passwords.   The  default is to allow single-case pass-
          words.

     <B>WhiteSpace </B><I>yes </I>| <I>no</I>
          Allow  whitespace   characters   in   passwords.    The
          <I>isspace</I>(3)  routine  is  used  to  determine this.  The
          default is to allow whitespace characters.

<B>BUGS</B>
     The <B>npasswd </B>history  database  is  protected   from  general
     access.  Any application using this library will need to run
     with privileges in order to  perform  the  password  history
     check.  On Digital UNIX systems, membership in group <I>auth </I>is
     needed to read the authorization files.
