Npasswd dictionary README %W% %G% 

The word list distribution is available at:

	ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/people/clyde/npasswd/words

The installation procedure (invoked via make) will build hash
databases from the word lists and install them in the default npasswd
dictionary directory.

The lists are compressed with GNU compress (gzip).

See the file "WORDS-TO-USE" in the distribution for help.
