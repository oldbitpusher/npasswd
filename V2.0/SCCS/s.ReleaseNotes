Release notes for npasswd 2.0

Npasswd is a replacement for the passwd command for UNIX.
It subjects user passwords to stringent guessability checks to
decrease the chance of users choosing vulnerable passwords.

It addresses other deficiencies found of standard password change
programs. Npasswd is designed to replace the programs passwd, chfn and chsh. 

	* Uses 'Crack' to check passwords.
	* Offers password reuse control.
	* Loads characteristics from a configuration file.
	* Should build and install "out of the box" on many UNIX platforms.
	* Written in ANSI and (pretty much) POSIX C.
	* Should be clean of "buffer overflow" security problems.

Documentation:

	The documentation is a set of HTML pages in the doc directory.
	Point a Web browser (lynx will work just fine) at:

		./doc/index.html

Other stuff:
	* There is a large collection of word lists available under
	  seperate cover (to keep the program distribution archive small).
	  See ./dict/0-README for details

	* If you are doing development or major repair on npasswd,
	  the you need to get the developer's kit which has
	  all the metaconfig units used to build the Configure script
	  and other tools.
