?S:usemymalloc:
?S:	This variable contains y if the malloc that comes with this package
?S:	is desired over the system's version of malloc.  People often include
?S:	special versions of malloc for effiency, but such versions are often
?S:	less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.
?S:.
?S:mallocsrc:
?S:	This variable contains the name of the malloc.c that comes with
?S:	the package, if that malloc.c is preferred over the system malloc.
?S:	Otherwise the value is null.  This variable is intended for generating
?S:	Makefiles.
?S:.
?S:d_mymalloc:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines MYMALLOC in case other parts
?S:	of the source want to take special action if MYMALLOC is used.
?S:	This may include different sorts of profiling or error detection.
?S:.
?S:mallocobj:
?S:	This variable contains the name of the malloc.o that this package
?S:	generates, if that malloc.o is preferred over the system malloc.
?S:	Otherwise the value is null.  This variable is intended for generating
?S:	Makefiles.  See mallocsrc.
?S:.
?S:malloctype:
?S:	This variable contains the kind of ptr returned by malloc and realloc.
?S:.
?C:Malloc_t (MALLOCPTRTYPE):
?C:	This symbol is the type of pointer returned by malloc and realloc.
?C:.

?C:MYMALLOC:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that we're using our own malloc.

?H:.
?X: Cannot test for mallocsrc; it is the unit's name and there is a bug in
?X: the interpreter which defines all the names, even though they are not used.
