ARGGGHHHH!!!!!

SCO csh still thinks true is false.  Write to SCO today and tell them that next
year Configure ought to "rm /bin/csh" unless they fix their blasted shell. :-)

(Actually, Configure ought to just patch csh in place.  Hmm.  Hmmmmm.  All
we'd have to do is go in and swap the && and || tokens, wherever they are.)

[End of diatribe. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming...]

I will attempt to remedy the situation by running sh for you...

?X:
?X: There are two schools of thoughts here. Some people correctly argue that
?X: the user has a better chance than we do of setting a reasonable PATH and
?X: others argue that Configure is the best place there is to set up a suitable
?X: PATH. Well, here we try to compromize by keeping the user's PATH and
?X: appending some directories which are known to work on some machine or the
?X: other. The rationale behind this being that a novice user might not have a
?X: proper environment variable set, and some directories like /etc (where
?X: chown is located on some BSD systems) may be missing--RAM.
?X:
?X: SVR4 adds an /opt directory for optional packages.  Some sites use
?X: various permutations on /opt as opposed to /usr or /usr/local.-- ADO
?X:
?X: We only add directories that are not already in the PATH of the
?X: user and the directories must exist also.
