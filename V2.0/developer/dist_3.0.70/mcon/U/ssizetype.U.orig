?S:ssizetype:
?S:	This variable defines ssizetype to be something like ssize_t, 
?S:	long or int.  It is used by functions that return a count 
?S:	of bytes or an error condition.  It must be a signed type.
?S:	We will pick a type such that sizeof(SSize_t) == sizeof(Size_t).
?S:.
?C:SSize_t:
?C:	This symbol holds the type used by functions that return
?C:	a count of bytes or an error condition.  It must be a signed type.
?C:	It is usually ssize_t, but may be long or int, etc.
?C:	It may be necessary to include <sys/types.h> or <unistd.h>
?C:	to get any typedef'ed information.
?C:	We will pick a type such that sizeof(SSize_t) == sizeof(Size_t).

I need a type that is the same size as $sizetype, but is guaranteed to
be signed.  Common values are int and long.
